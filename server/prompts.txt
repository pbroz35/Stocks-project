Following Elon Musk's bold assertions about "solving autonomy," a Truist Securities analyst took a out for a ride to test its Full
Self-Driving capabilities.
In a note seen by Business Insider, Truist analyst William Stein said the technology was "arguably worse than last time." In its

the weather was clear and dry, which also matched the conditions of the last drive.
Stein flagged Tesla's "demo mode" as one of the surprising features, which is only available during demo drives. Stein said during

lanes, and the drive "felt more natural overall" than the previous version.
However, he maintained that "solving" may not be the right word for autonomy. Stein added that, "we are still befuddled at what

Musk has said Tesla's driverless taxi business will function like "a combination of Airbnb and Uber." that he would be "shocked"
if the first Robotaxi ride wasn't possible next year, although he was unable to give an exact timeline. He also admitted he tended
to be optimistic when giving estimates.
A spokesperson for Tesla didn't immediately return a request for comment in response to the note.
