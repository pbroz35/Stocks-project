The Android world has enjoyed for six years, but Apple stans may soon be able to take part—a folding might arrive in 2026,
according to .
The project, codenamed V68, is in early development and there's no guarantee it will come to fruition, but the report says it has
moved past the conceptual stage and suppliers are involved. This would be Apple's first major design change to its flagship
product since the in 2017. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report of a folding iPhone.
Apple's move comes at a time when the popularity of folding smartphones is soaring across the world. Analytics firm Counterpoint
Research reports that the folding phone market in the first quarter of 2024, its highest rate of increase in six quarters.
Shipments of iPhones were , so a folding iPhone just might be what Apple needs to boost sales.
But foldables aren't just more popular—they're more mature too. The latest models are far more refined and more durable than the
clumsy early attempts. Samsung has spent the past six years publicly tweaking its folding smartphones—every year has brought small
changes to the , improving the durability of the screen and the reliability of the hinge. These were the biggest failings of the
form factor in the early days of foldables, but advances in glass technology and hinge engineering have brought 2024's folding
devices ever closer to a level of quality that matches what's expected of a . Samsung's latest models have , and while it's still
not as dust-resistant as its nonfolding counterparts, it's one step bringing it closer.
Samsung may have the longest track record, but competition is at the heels, with and lobbing off large chunks of Samsung's market
share, and new devices from and vying for consumer's attention. That means there's more manufacturing capability to craft these
folding phones, though they remain expensive—while Motorola offers a $700 folding flip phone, Samsung just raised the .
All this action in the market makes it the perfect time for Apple to join the folding fray.
Apple has reportedly tested products in two sizes, but this greenlit project is for a folding flip phone, much like the Razr from
Motorola or Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip6. These kinds of flip phones allow you to enjoy a full-size smartphone, and then fold it in
half to stuff it in a pocket or bag. You get the same smartphone experience but in a tiny package. There's usually an external
upcoming ) there.
There's likely not much that Apple has to worry about on the developer front in terms of app compatibility—the company has been
laying the groundwork for apps to resize and work on any Apple platform ever since the introduction of the . iPhone apps are , and
the Vision Pro headset can run mobile apps. Apps on iPad can enjoy to take advantage of the tablet's larger screen. This doesn't
affect a fliplike folding phone, but should Apple decide to announce a booklike folding phone, like the iPad-shaped Samsung's
Galaxy Z Fold6, there should be a wide number of apps ready to take advantage of the increased screen real estate.
But starting with a flip phone makes sense for Apple as the design choice inherently solves the problem of a Too Big phone in a
Too Small pocket. These phones are also cute and retro, and I can imagine celebrities will hop on the bandwagon immediately—after
all, Motorola already got its launch event and show off its new Razr+.
Apple has a history of coming into an established market late, releasing a more mature product that feels informed by the hits and
the misses of what's come before it. But also, expectations around foldables have been set in the minds of the buying public, so
it will be interesting to see what Apple will drum up to make its late-to-the-game flip stand out.

Attractive! Accurate. Durable. Advanced health insights like body composition and AGEs index. Has navigation features like Track
Back and compass.
Weirdly hard to navigate. Not all features are available on non-Samsung phones. AGEs index is puzzling. Other trackers still have
better features, software, and algorithms (for now).
To test the Galaxy Watch Ultra, I had to take off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 () with a mere two days left to go before completing my
age to gauge whether your efforts are improving your fitness performance or not. It was annoying to be so close and not finish.
However, it was not as annoying as it might have been, since I've tried this feature before. Garmin has had feature for years.
In the race to create the most fully-featured outdoor smartwatch that works well with your phone, Apple is clearly winning. The ’s
design is more visually distinctive. The software is better, with more sports like diving, better algorithms like Training Load,
and a better UI. It’s also hilarious how closely the Galaxy Watch Ultra’s design mimics Apple’s, with a safety orange band that
looks exactly like Apple’s and a Quick Button on the side where you can assign a function, like Apple’s Action button. There’s
even a gesture-based feature very similar to Double Tap, which is called (still laughing) Double Pinch.
With all that said, Samsung has the resources to catch up quickly, and I found no major flaws. If you’re pretty happy as an user
and would like the experience of wearing an Apple Watch Ultra, this is a decent start. It can only get better.
The Galaxy Watch Ultra is very pretty. It’s not as visually distinctive as the Apple Watch Ultra, but its design does echo the
look of a high-end or watch. It’s a 47-mm smartwatch, which makes it slightly smaller than the Watch Ultra’s 49-mm case, but it
feels bigger because it’s square instead of rectangular.
It has a titanium case with a sapphire glass face that is rated to 10 ATM (which means it can withstand the pressure exerted by
Fahrenheit. I didn't have the opportunity to bag a while testing, but I did stupidly go biking to run errands with temperatures
well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in a heat wave, and the watch operated well (I did not).
Battery life is my main issue with these smartwatches turned extreme fitness trackers. The Watch Ultra can last a little longer
than two days, which is great for a smartwatch but far below what you’d need for your average weekend camping trip. Every other
morning, it took three hours to charge the watch back up from 10 or 15 percent. With Power Saving mode on, the watch could last up
to three to five days. I like being able to tinker with the settings to figure out what to turn off or keep on to extend the
battery life.
Samsung notes that the watch has a new enhanced BioActive sensor, which increases the accuracy of the heart rate sensor and other
new health metrics. It's remarkably consistent with what I track on my —for example, if the Oura said my heart rate was 69, the
live reading on the Galaxy Watch Ultra was 70.
The other new feature is the AGEs index. According to Samsung, the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra can measure your advanced
glycation end products (AGEs). (Diagnoptics is the company that powers the tool, which via a light source that excites specific
fluorescent moieties, or molecule parts, on your skin). Your AGEs index is important because it can help predict the risk of
diabetes and stroke; the way most people do this now is by taking a test called an A1C, which is a more invasive blood test.
It’s possible that some watches will have noninvasive blood sugar testing soon; for example, to track blood sugar readings on the
watch. I have a family history of stroke and diabetes, and completely coincidentally, got full blood labs complete with A1C and a
lipids panel while wearing the Galaxy Watch Ultra. All I can say is, if you're worried about diabetes or stroke, I suggest talking
to a doctor instead. I have a genetic predisposition to these conditions; my panels were clear, my AGEs index is high. I didn't
find this measurement to be useful, as there's no context at all.
The body fat composition measurements were relatively consistent and in line with what I would consider for myself as a healthy,
athletic woman—my readings cycled more or less around 27 percent body fat, which is … well, it's fine. If this interests you, I
suggest remembering to measure yourself in the morning before you eat anything, because that number will be more flattering. It’s
also worth noting here that some features, like ECG, are not available if you’re not using a Samsung phone.
When it comes to sleep, Samsung has also taken a page from Fitbit’s book. After a week of taking measurements, it provides you
with a sleep animal to better interpret your sleep patterns. I am a penguin, which is a good sleeper who gets enough sleep but
wakes up too often because I check my eggs. This was incredibly accurate, because by “eggs,” Samsung has intuited that I have a
new puppy who likes to sleep on my pillow and kick my head all night. She does this often enough that I was able to wake up and
confirm the times on the watch and in the app.
The Galaxy Watch Ultra also has dual-band GPS for greater accuracy. I ran, rock-climbed, hiked, paddled, and walked my dogs twice
a day while testing the watch. Again, the heart rate measurements were shockingly similar to the measurements on my Apple Watch
Ultra (for example, both recorded my dog walks at 88 bpm) and the paths were accurate.
The Galaxy Watch Ultra autodetected all my random biking and walking adventures throughout the day. While some of the metrics it
measures are pretty rudimentary compared with what you get with Garmin or Apple Watch, others are more advanced. For example, when
I go on a run, the metrics that I want are slightly harder to find and read, but you can still see your cadence, asymmetry, and
vertical oscillation.
As someone who gets lost the instant they leave their car, I also liked that the watch has basic navigation options, like a
compass and Track Back (which Apple calls ). It’s a little harder to find and use—you have to swipe through settings after you’ve
started an activity—but it exists! I also liked that in its sports metrics, it also counts probable water loss. It turns out I
have probably not been drinking enough water in this heat.
It also doesn’t have some of the same sports as the Apple Watch Ultra, most notably scuba diving, which brings me to my last
point.
I switched from my to the to make sure I wasn’t missing any features, and, like—OK, this is shallow, but it’s a huge part of
Apple’s appeal—Samsung watches just aren't as easy to use, and not as many cool things happen. That's not even counting if you're
using an Android phone that's not a Samsung. Is a certain feature in Samsung Health or Samsung Health Monitor? Or Google Fit?
Apple used to be more complicated, but now it’s as simple as waking up and checking my Vitals app and Training Load.
This manifests in other ways as well. For example, the Galaxy Watch Ultra can measure FTP, an important metric for high-performing
cyclists, but unlike the Apple Watch Ultra, starting the activity doesn't automatically turn the S23+ into a bike computer that
you mount on your handlebars. If you do go off the grid, the Galaxy phones don’t have satellite connectivity or messaging (yet).
Still, these are minor quibbles. Samsung definitely has the resources to support these options in future updates, and I’m curious
to see features like the AGEs index leave the experimental phase. It’s a pretty watch that’s accurate and comfortable and
attractive to wear, and what it does, it generally does well. “That's a watch that looks like it can bike,” a friend said, noting
my new arm candy as I was out. If you have a Samsung phone and enjoy outdoor sports, it's worth trying out.

If you’re then you already have GarageBand. It’s free and surprisingly capable. If you’re considering getting one of the many
entry-level DAWs out there for $99, I highly recommend you give GarageBand a go instead. Where other budget DAWs might limit you
to 16 tracks or offer you only a tiny subset of their built-in effects and instruments, GarageBand gives you 255 tracks and access
to its full suite of tools for exactly zero dollars. That includes its mobile app, which allows you to whip up an idea on your
iPhone or iPad and then transfer it to your desktop for further arrangement.
One of its best features is the automatic drummer. This gives you a quick groove to play along with in a variety of styles with
some minimal options for tweaking. You’re probably not going to create the next chart-topping hit with the auto drummer (although
Rihanna did use a GarageBand drummer preset for “Umbrella”), but it’s incredibly useful for tossing together a quick demo.
Best of all, GarageBand has a simple upgrade path if you find yourself brushing up against its limits. Logic Pro is only $199,
much cheaper than many competing DAWs, and it can natively handle your GarageBand projects. —Terrence O'Brien
Tablet-based music production has existed in some form since shortly debuted in 2010, and musicians have been using loop pedals to
stack layers of sound in a live environment for almost three decades. These two worlds finally converged in a meaningful way with
the release of Loopy Pro, that puts live looping at the forefront of the music-making process. At its core, the upstart DAW,
developed by a small Australian developer called A Tasty Pixel, is an empty sandbox that uses color-coded loops as its primary
building block. Users can overdub, reverse, and pitch-bend each loop as a group or independently. Loops are easy to export via
iPadOS’s familiar sharing workflow, and Loopy Pro serves as a sturdy host for third-party plug-ins via the AUV3 format in case you
need things like drum machines, synths, sequencers, and effects.
If live looping is all Loopy Pro did, it would be well worth it. But a host of subtly brilliant utility features that are easy to
organize within the DAW’s expansive architecture puts it over the top as far as utilities for gigging musicians go. The pencil
icon opens up a world of customizable widgets like buttons, sliders, and toggles that can do everything from control loop
parameters, toggle AUV3 effects on and off, and send an infinite number of MIDI messages via Bluetooth or a wired connection
through a USB-C hub or interface. I use Loopy Pro daily to wrangle a massive pedalboard of MIDI-based guitar effects, all of which
have their dedicated page that matches the knobs, buttons, and physical color of the stomp box itself. Recording a session of
brainstorms and riffs has never been easier to track, organize, and save thanks to Loopy Pro. —Pete Cottell
If you find yourself attending recording classes, mixing in professional studios, or are after an internship somewhere fancy, you
need to know how to use Pro Tools. This is the industry-standard DAW for recording, and it's been a mainstay in every major studio
for decades (even if many now also offer other software).
Pro Tools, with its color-coded tracks, easy comping of live takes, and tried-and-true workflows, has become so ingrained in the
hearts, eyes, ears, and minds of old-time industry pros for a reason: It sounds great, works great for editing and tracking
musicians, and was some of the most powerful software around when it first came out (and for many generations thereafter). While
you can get plenty of mileage out of other software on this list, whenever I have worked with professionals in real studios, I
have had to bounce out my tracks from my regular software (Studio One) as stems for import in Pro Tools. If used Pro Tools in the
first place, I could simply cross-export files.
The reason many folks dislike the software? It's very expensive, as is , the brand that owns Pro Tools. Many studios forgo
updating computers for a very long time for this reason, and this is why Pro Tools doesn't have many modern features that I've
seen in other DAWs, like the drag-and-drop functionality for plug-ins offered by Logic and Studio One.
Still, this software is excellent, and if you can get over its old-school interface, it is capable of doing any musical task you
can dream of. There is a reason it has stood the test of time; it (usually) runs well, and it's never annoying enough that it's
worth switching for power users.
Ableton Live was originally created for live performance. It was a way to bring onstage the electronic music people were creating
on their computers. It’s still the best DAW if you plan to perform live with a computer. But over 20-plus years it has grown into
a studio powerhouse.
Its unique loop-based workflow of Scenes and Clips has its origins on the stage, but it also makes it easy to iterate on ideas,
experiment with different combinations of song components, and sketch out an arrangement. For deeper dives and fine-tuning, there
is the Arrangement view, which offers the kind of timeline-based recording and editing you’d expect.
All of the native synths and plug-ins for Live are excellent and easily hold their own against pricey VSTs. Plus, Ableton has a
purpose-built MIDI controller in the , which is one of the best ways to access the full power of your DAW without having to spend
your whole time messing with a mouse and keyboard.
The biggest problem is that Ableton Live is expensive. The Intro version costs $99, but it’s pretty limited, and it often comes
bundled for free with even the cheapest MIDI controllers. Live Suite, which includes all 20 instruments, 58 effects, and over 70
GB of sounds, will set you back $749. And, if you spring for Push, that’s another grand. —Terrence O'Brien
Logic Pro is an extension of Apple’s GarageBand, making it a natural choice for Apple fans looking to level up. You can think of
Logic as a GarageBand graduate program, elevating your efforts from amateur demos to professional-grade recordings. You’ll find
myriad ways to explore and advance your skills, from powerful plug-ins and effects to notation and editing tools that let you
personalize your workflow.
I’ve been using a version of Logic in my home studio for over 15 years because it’s my ideal program for music creation. Logic’s
Takes are a key part of my process, making it astonishingly easy to do multiple reps of instrument runs or vocal lines on the fly,
comp the best of each, and manipulate them to perfection. With a balanced blend of advanced features and intuitive creation tools,
Logic is a go-to program for any home studio that runs on . —Ryan Waniata
Since dropping about a year ago, Logic Pro for iPad has been quietly gaining traction as the easiest DAW for newbies to cut their
teeth on. A hands-on tutorial system and a staggering array of built-in synth engines, drum machines, loops, and effects make this
a great place to start if you’re new to iPad-based music production, or digital music production in general. Whether you’re a
power user for Logic on a desktop or a novice who’s ready to graduate from GarageBand, the portable iteration of Apple’s stalwart
music production suite is easy, affordable (just $6 per month or $50 per year, and packed to the gills with advanced features that
can nudge a collection of loops towards a polished final product in under an hour. Desktop users will love that their projects are
round-trippable between the two devices as well.
Recently I downloaded Logic Pro and some YouTube tutorials on my iPad Pro before a 4-hour flight, and within an hour I built a
vibey chillwave track complete with bouncy arpeggios, off-kilter ping-pong delays, and warm analog pads ducked by heavy sidechain
compression—all with built-in instruments and effects. Logic Pro handles third-party AUV3 plug-ins like a boss, but the handy
indexing of the onboard kits makes it super easy to punch in a few keywords, like “chillwave” and “analog synth,” which is an
unbeatable workflow enhancement that strengthens the case for Logic Pro’s bid at best in class. Whether you’re completely green or
simply hungover and uninspired, the in-house DAW of Tim Cook’s walled garden is a near-perfect option for producers on the move.
FL Studio (née Fruity Loops) is the OG countless bedroom producers cut their teeth on in the late ’90s and early ’00s. Its
easy-to-grasp Roland TR-style step sequencer and powerful sample manipulation tools make it a favorite of countless hip-hop and
dance producers like 9th Wonder, WundaGurl, Deadmau5, and Avicii. Despite its surface simplicity, FL Studio is also extremely
powerful once you come to grips with its sometimes convoluted workflow. It’s designed for creating electronic and sample-based
music instead of tracking a band, but you can record live instruments if you want.
Perhaps FL Studio’s best feature is its value. The $99 Fruity Edition is even more limited than Live Intro, but the top-tier All
Plugins version is only $499. That includes 113 instruments and effects and, regardless of which edition you pick, it comes with a
Fender-owned Presonus has been making waves with its Studio One software for the past several years, and I am a huge fan. Studio
One offers the same awesome drag-and-drop functionality of Logic, the same ease of tracking, editing, and mixing as Pro Tools, and
the same live performance features as Ableton, all in one. I particularly like how you can integrate the software directly with ;
when you use Studio One, everything seems to talk nice and play well together, which feels uncommon in the world of recording.
Now that Fender owns the brand, we've been getting better and better instrument and amp plug-ins natively in the software, as well
as some nifty new hardware/software collaborations between the brands, such as a Fender-logoed instrument input on . I have now
recorded numerous albums for loads of artists using Studio One, and the only downside is that most professional mixing engineers
don't use it, so you have to export your stems rather than an entire save file. Frankly, it's good practice to be able to properly
bounce out stems, and it doesn't take long in this software. If your friends do happen to also record using Studio One, though,
it's really easy to share entire projects over the internet, and the company makes it very easy to master and export tracks
straight to Soundcloud, should you want to always be sharing your latest work without much extra effort.
I've been impressed, especially at its lower price than other premium recording software. Each update comes with more and more
user-requested features, which isn't something I can say about other software above (*cough, Pro Tools, cough*). I highly
recommend giving Studio One a shot if you want something easy to use on Windows, Mac, and iPad (though the iPad app is just a
remote controller for the software).
You can make insanely awesome music using virtually any modern recording equipment or digital audio workstation, cheap or
otherwise. I'm not kidding: There have been award-winning albums recorded on iPhones, mixed on GarageBand or other free software,
or even recorded to four-track cassette (here's looking at you, future Elliott Smiths and Bruce Springsteens). This list is meant
to highlight the reasons you might want to choose one piece of software over another rather than to claim that you can't make
excellent music with any of them.

The OnTrac's design is also extremely customizable; Dyson is letting users swap out ear cushions and the outer caps of the earcups
to change their colors. At launch there will be only four color options, but Dyson says more choices will be coming later. The
company says the headphones will have many of the hallmarks of a modern premium headset, including noise canceling that can reduce
up to 40 decibels of noise. Dyson says the OnTrac also will come with a truly insane battery life of 55 hours under normal use.
The OnTrac headphones aren’t for sale yet, and Dyson hasn’t indicated when they will be. But once they’re available, they’ll start
at $500, with some customizations driving the price up from there.

use it without the subscription. It's quite another to charge a monthly subscription fee on top of an already expensive
wearable—especially when and cost a comparable amount and don't have any subscription fees at all.

Y Combinator is famed for its , where portfolio companies pitch their apps and wares in hopes of growing from a fledgling company
into the next . But on Thursday, the startup incubator hosted a mélange of founders, venture capitalists, and US policymakers in
its airy industrial space in San Francisco to tackle a defining topic for so many startups today: as the latest frontier in the
battle between Big Tech and the little guys.
For many early-stage tech entrepreneurs, questions about AI can carry existential weight. Ever since , OpenAI’s technology, along
with fast follows from Google’s and Microsoft’s AI teams, has dominated the conversation in this new era of artificial
intelligence. But the increasing availability—and potency—of has the potential to upend those dynamics.
On Thursday, the enthusiasm for open source extended beyond just YC-backed founders who stand to benefit from a less expensive way
to harness generative AI’s power. , was one of the most prominent advocates for open source AI at the event.
Speaking to a crowd of approximately 200 entrepreneurs, Khan said it’s not an exaggeration to suggest that nearly all of Y
Combinator's most successful companies wouldn’t exist without open source software and the community behind it. The FTC has been
focused on defining and exploring open-weights AI models, which are slightly less “open” than fully open source AI models. With
open-weights models available to them, “smaller players can bring their ideas to market,” Khan suggested.
Khan also clearly articulated the stakes for this particular crowd. “Conditions have allowed the biggest technology companies to
get a leg up in the AI race,” she said. “If you control the raw materials, you can control the market and shut out smaller
Khan’s statements were made as part of a broader argument for fair and open competition in the tech industry, and in defense of
the regulatory actions the FTC and the US Justice Department have taken against Big Tech companies over the past four years. US
assistant attorney general Jonathan Kanter spoke Thursday at YC, too, emphasizing that the agencies are looking out for “little
tech”—a phrase that would resonate with the YC crowd.
The appearance of two regulatory heavyweights before a community of this “move fast and break things” crowd might have seemed
unlikely as recently as a year ago. Founded in 2005 by the entrepreneurs Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston, among others, YC is
more famously known for the intense mentorship and bootcamp-like atmosphere it provides fledgling companies than for its ties to
the DC establishment.
The shift is intentional. Last October, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan brought on policy expert Luther Lowe to help facilitate
conversations between YC and DC. The arrival of Lowe, who spent more than 15 years in public policy at Yelp and was one of
Google’s most prominent critics, has clearly brought a certain polish and high-profile policy talk to YC events. Thursday marked
the second time that FTC chairperson Khan has spoken to YC founders since Lowe joined.
Many of yesterday’s talks were littered with the acronyms you’d expect from this assemblage of high-minded panelists: YC, FTC, AI,
LLMs. But threaded throughout the conversations—foundational to them, you might say—was boosterism for open source AI.
It was a stark left turn (or return, if you’re a Linux head) from the app-obsessed 2010s, when developers seemed happy to
containerize their technologies and hand them over to bigger platforms for distribution.
The event also happened just two days after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared that “open source AI is the path forward” and , the
latest version of Meta’s own open source AI algorithm. As Zuckerberg put it in his announcement, some technologists no longer want
to be “constrained by what Apple will let us build,” or encounter arbitrary rules and app fees.
Open source AI also just happens to be the approach OpenAI is not using for its biggest GPTs, despite what the multibillion-dollar
startup’s name might suggest. This means that at least part of the code is kept private, and OpenAI doesn’t share the “weights,”
or parameters, of its most powerful AI systems. It also charges for enterprise-level access to its technology.
better results than an [OpenAI] GPT4, or [Google] Gemini. This is especially true for enterprise tasks,” says Ali Golshan,
cofounder and chief executive of Gretel.ai, a synthetic data company. (Golshan was not at the YC event).
successful YC alumni to back up-and-coming YC founders. “I think it’s about creating fair competition and an environment where
startups don’t risk just dying the next day if OpenAI changes their pricing models or their policies.”
Open source AI models have some inherent risks that more cautious technologists have warned about—the most obvious being that the
technology is open and free. People with malicious intent are more likely to use these tools for harm then they would a costly
private AI model. Researchers have pointed out that it’s for bad actors to train away any safety parameters present in these AI
models.
restrict developers from building certain things, and ultimately, they may still benefit the original model-maker more than anyone
else.
And some politicians have pushed back against the unfettered development of large-scale AI systems, including California state
senator Scott Wiener. Wiener’s AI Safety and Innovation Bill, SB 1047, has been controversial in technology circles. It aims to
establish standards for developers of AI models that cost over $100 million to train, requires certain levels of pre-deployment
safety testing and red-teaming, protects whistleblowers working in AI labs, and grants the state’s attorney general legal recourse
if an AI model causes extreme harm.
Wiener himself spoke at the YC event on Thursday, in a conversation moderated by Bloomberg reporter Shirin Ghaffary. He said he
was “deeply grateful” to people in the open source community who have spoken out against the bill, and that the state has “made a
series of amendments in direct response to some of that critical feedback.” One change that’s been made, Wiener said, is that the
bill now more clearly defines a reasonable path to shutting down an open source AI model that’s gone off the rails.
The celebrity speaker of Thursday’s event, a last-minute addition to the program, was Andrew Ng, the cofounder of Coursera,
founder of Google Brain, and former chief scientist at Baidu. Ng, like many others in attendance, spoke in defense of open source
models.

In this case, it's Amazon. This year's Prime Day Apple deals include our top-rated devices—including MacBooks, AirPods, iPads, and
more. We threw in a few of our favorite accessories that are on sale too. In addition to Apple deals, we've got bell-to-bell Prime

The latest M3-powered Air () isn't vastly different from the version with M2. It has the same 13.6-inch LCD screen (with a 60-Hz
refresh rate and 500 nits of max brightness), a notch at the top of the display that houses a 1080p webcam, and a variety of ports
last year, isn't a major leap from the previous processor, but it offers a nice boost in performance compared to the original M1.
You can also use it with two external displays simultaneously, as long as you keep the lid closed (which is an upgrade from the
single external display on older chips). It's a great choice—especially if you're looking for a reliable and lightweight laptop
for everyday tasks. The coupon takes an additional $50 off, bringing it down to $849—which is the lowest price we've seen for this
model.
Apple MacBook Pro (14 Inch and 16 Inch, Late 2023)
You can snag these Pro models for even steeper discounts on Amazon if you clip the on-page coupon. While M4-powered MacBooks are
imminent, the with M3 Pro and M3 Max are less than a year old—so it's still an excellent choice. Both sizes pack a bright Mini LED
screen, a 120-Hz refresh rate, and a 1080p webcam. Most importantly, you'll also have plenty of ports including three USB-C ports
with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, an SD card slot, a high-impedance headphone jack, and a MagSafe charging port. Since various
configurations are on sale, you might be stuck on which to go with. We recommend the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro for
intermediate content creators who want a laptop that's easier to travel with. The 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Max () is a great
option if you want a big display and excellent battery life.
The M2-powered iPad Air () launched recently in May and it's already on sale. You'll have the choice between an 11-inch display
and a new, larger 13-inch one. I prefer the latter, which I've been using as a secondary display during the workday and for
watching TV before bed. It's a bit brighter too, with a 2,732 x 2,048-pixel resolution and the ability to hit 600 nits of peak
brightness in Standard Dynamic Range. Like its predecessor, it packs the same slim bezels, USB-C port, and Touch ID built into the
top power button. Thankfully, Apple also moved the front-facing 12-MP camera to landscape orientation. The M2 chip delivers smooth
performance too, even with tons of apps running simultaneously. Despite the bigger size, battery life remains the same, but you'll
still get about six hours on a busy day.
The iPad (10th-gen) () is a great tablet for most people. It comes with a variety of notable upgrades compared to its predecessor,
including a larger 10.9-inch Liquid Retina (IPS LCD) display, slimmer bezels, Touch ID integrated into the power button, a
camera has been moved to the center of the iPad. So, you'll no longer have to stare awkwardly to the side during video calls.
Under the hood is also an A14 Bionic chip (which can be found in the iPhone 12), which delivers slightly faster performance and a
bump in graphics over the .
These are the latest AirPods Pro () and the most feature-packed too. They come with a new Conversation Awareness feature, which
lowers your music and background noise when it detects you're having a conversation. As with the second-generation AirPods Pro
with Lightning, it also comes with Adaptive Transparency mode (which combines noise cancellation and transparency to adjust
audio). The sound quality is above average as well—with authoritative bass, crisp highs, and excellent noise cancellation.
Equipped with the U1 chip, you can also use the Precision Finding feature in the Find My app (for anyone with the iPhone 11 and
newer), which gives you onscreen directions on your iPhone to the exact location of the case.
Apple's AirPods Max () deliver excellent sound with a massive soundstage, rich bass, and fantastic noise cancellation. This is
also we've tracked for these headphones, so far. They have great build quality too, with a springy mesh headband and soft fabric
earcups (that are also replaceable). We're particularly fans of the volume knob, which looks similar to the one you'd find on an
Apple Watch, that allows you to adjust the volume. We also love how well these headphones integrate with iOS devices—with the
ability to switch back and forth between devices (like your iPhone and MacBook) without having to go through your Bluetooth
settings manually. However, it's important to note that, , it's highly likely a new version of AirPods Max is coming later this
year. But it looks like the only major change will be the addition of a USB-C port instead of Lightning. So, if that's super
important to you, we suggest holding off.
The Series 9 () is currently our favorite Apple Watch in our guide to . It looks the same as the Series 8, but it does come with a
few upgrades, including faster performance, a brighter display, and improved battery life. It also comes equipped with the Double
Tap feature, which triggers functions like playing music or hanging up a call by simply tapping your index finger and thumb. It'll
also (coming later this year) so you'll have access to new features like tracking health metrics at a glance via the Vitals app
and measuring performance improvements with the new Training Load algorithm. It is, however, important to note that due to a
patent dispute, Apple has disabled the blood oxygen sensor on models sold directly through its stores. But this doesn't apply if
you purchase the smartwatch through third-party retailers like Amazon.
The Ultra 2 () is our top pick for outdoor sports. In addition to onboard precision dual-frequency GPS, it also comes equipped
with offline maps (you'll have to download them to your iPhone and stay within Bluetooth range of the watch, though), and the
ability to see your cycling session as a Live Activity on your iPhone. It has the same Action button that was introduced on the
first-gen version, which you can use to start Backtrack—Apple's navigation feature that creates virtual breadcrumb trails on the
Compass app that you can then follow back home. It's also powered by the S9 chip for performance and an ultra-wideband chip with
enhanced precision finding features (to pinpoint and lead you to your iPhone). You'll have access to Double Tap as well. This is
the lowest price we've seen for the Ultra 2, so far.
If you don't need fancy features like checking your blood oxygen or skin temperature, then the Apple Watch SE is a great choice.
It's also our go-to pick for most people. You'll still have access to all the basic fitness tracking features and it's compatible
with watchOS 11, so you'll also be able to use features like the Training Load Algorithm and Vitals app. And, thanks to the S8
chip, it comes with additional capabilities like the redesigned Compass app, support for international roaming, and Crash Dection

if you completed a workout but didn't track it with a wearable, does it still count? Yes, it does. But if you're trying to
optimize your exercise routine and up the ante on your progress, then a smartwatch is an excellent gadget to use. If you're an
iPhone user, the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 are the top three picks in our guide to the . And,
each one is currently on sale for Prime Day. The discount will vary depending on the color option and size of each model, but
you'll find the Series 9 for as low as $252 ($147 off), the SE for $150 ($99 off), and the Apple Watch Ultra for $700 ($99 off).
These are the lowest prices we've seen for these smartwatches.
The Series 9 () doesn't come with any major changes compared with its predecessor, but there are a few noteworthy upgrades. It
comes with a brighter display (you'll get 2,000 nits of brightness compared to 1,000 on the Series 8), faster performance thanks
to the latest S9 chipset, and improved battery life. It also has the new Double Tap feature, which triggers functions like hanging
up a call, dismissing an alarm, and playing music by simply tapping your index finger and thumb together. It'll support watchOS 11

Apple has disabled the blood oxygen sensor on models sold directly through its stores. But if you're buying it through Amazon,
you'll find the best deals on the Red (which is currently at $252) and Midnight colorways in the 41-mm size.
The Apple Watch SE is the best option for most people. It's an entry-level wearable that packs all the basic fitness tracking
features. It's also a great option if you don't need the fancier capabilities like checking your blood oxygen or skin temperature.
But with the S8 chip, you'll have access to additional features like Crash Detection (to call your emergency contact and emergency
responders if you've been in a car accident), the redesigned Compass app, and support for international roaming. It's compatible
with the aforementioned watchOS 11 as well, so you'll be able to use features like the Vitals app and the Training Load algorithm.
It's worth noting that while all colors are on sale (in both sizes), the lowest price applies to the Midnight color with the 40-mm
case size.
The second-generation Ultra () is our favorite smartwatch for outdoor sports. It has an onboard precision dual-frequency GPS
system and the ability to access offline maps (as long as you download them on your iPhone and it's within Bluetooth range of the
watch), and it also displays your cycling session as a Live Activity on your iPhone. As with the first-generation version, there's
also an Action button—which you can use to start Backtrack, Apple's navigation feature that creates virtual breadcrumb trails via
the Compass app that you can follow to get back home. As with the Series 9, it also comes equipped with the latest S9 chip, so
you'll get faster processing power, the feature, and a new ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding features (if you
lose your iPhone somewhere around the house, it'll pinpoint it and lead you to it). This is also the lowest price we've tracked
for the Ultra 2 so far.

It's a big day for Samsung. At its biannual Galaxy Unpacked event—held today in Paris just weeks before the Olympics
kickoff—Samsung took the wraps off of eight new devices, one of which is an entirely new product category for the company: a
health-tracking smart ring. The arrives at a time when there's growing interest and fresh competition in these miniature trackers
from the likes of and .
Alongside the Ring are the and —new versions of Samsung's folding phones that are now in their sixth generation. In the audio
department, the company showed off the and . The series as usual comes in two sizes. But unusually, there's a new . It takes a lot
of inspiration from the Apple Watch Ultra and, like Apple's premium wearable, it targets more serious athletes. (Samsung hosted
WIRED at its media event in Paris and paid for a portion of our reporter’s travel expenses.)
Here's everything you need to know about what Samsung announced.
access and exclusive subscriber-only content. .
Most of us are used to tracking health and fitness data through or . Smart rings have been increasingly popular because the tech's
miniaturization has improved, and who doesn't want to wear a small ring to do all this health tracking instead of a bulky watch?
Samsung's Galaxy Ring, teased earlier this , is a lightweight titanium ring that comes in black, silver, and gold finishes. The
company will ship out a ring-sizing kit once you place a preorder, but these rings will also be available at select retailers
later this year, in which case you'll be able to try them on in the store. (I, a 6'4" man, could fit only the maximum size 13 ring
on most of my fingers, so I'm a little worried folks with thick digits might have trouble.) There are nine size options.
It's and 10 ATM water resistant, so you can use it while in the shower or doing the dishes. It pairs with any Android phone
through the Samsung Health app, but it won't work with iPhones. You do not need a subscription to access the full suite of
features; all of the available features are included with the purchase. It also works with Samsung Find, so you can easily locate
it if it's misplaced. It has a charging case that works exactly like the case for your wireless earbuds. Samsung claims the Galaxy
Ring can last seven days on a single charge, matching the battery life of the Oura Ring.
The ring covers many health-tracking features you'd expect from a smartwatch, including sleep tracking, cycle tracking, high or
low heart rate alerts, and auto-workout detection. Samsung has talked up its use of artificial intelligence on the Ring, using
smart algorithms to monitor sleep patterns, snoring, and heart and respiratory rate to help you get more robust information about
your sleep.
More important is a feature called Energy Score, also available in the new Galaxy Watches. Much like Fitbit's Daily Readiness or
Garmin's Body Battery, it looks at your data and then recommends how ready you are to take on the day based on factors like sleep
quality and your recent activity levels. You'll also get “wellness tips” throughout the day to keep you on your health goals. If
you use both the Galaxy Ring and the new Galaxy Watch series simultaneously, some sensors may turn off in the watch to conserve
its battery life, which is something I haven't seen before.
The Ring does not provide haptic feedback, but you can perform some rudimentary gesture controls with your fingers for a few
tasks, like dismissing an alarm or starting a video recording on your phone. These “Double Pinch Gestures” are also available on
the Galaxy Watch7 series.
The Galaxy Ring is available for . It'll officially go on sale July 24. I'll be slipping the precious on my fingers very soon to
give it a test ride.
The new Galaxy Z Flip6 and Fold6 don't break much new ground over their predecessors. I feel like I've been saying that with every
new iteration over the past six years, but it's true! Samsung tends to refine its folding Android phone designs instead of making
drastic changes. Both handsets are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, just like every other flagship Android phone
of 2024. The Flip6 is Samsung's thinnest yet, and the Fold6 is shorter and wider than the last one. They're both boxier—gone are
the rounded curves in favor of sharp edges.
Most of what's new on these folding phones are the same Galaxy AI features . That includes , which can take advantage of the
larger 7.6-inch screen on the Fold6. These AI features have picked up new tricks, like how Circle to Search can now provide
solutions to mathematical equations (and how to solve them).
One fun new addition is “Sketch to Image.” I opened a photo of seashells on the beach in Samsung's Gallery app, pressed the AI
button, and drew a crude star. I tapped Generate and the phone drummed up a realistic-looking, star-shaped seashell right where I
doodled. It's pretty remarkable. (These images with generated sketches will be watermarked to indicate they were made with AI.)
Another to note is the real-time phone call translation feature—it's present on these phones, but now it works in any third-party
calling app like WhatsApp and Telegram.
Samsung is emphasizing the improved durability of these folding phones, citing improved scratch resistance and a new fourth layer
in the display that protects it from punctures. There's also a “dual-rail hinge” for better shock absorption in the event of a
drop. This might explain the slightly improved dust resistance—they have an rating like prior models.
On the Flip6, Samsung did not change the exterior screen; it's still a 3.6-inch display. This is the opposite of what Motorola did
in its . I prefer the 4-inch external screen on the Razr+ as it offers more space to see more of an app or notification. What's
new then? There are more interactive wallpapers and ones that react to real-time weather and the current amount of daylight. You
will also find a wider variety of widgets on this external display, and you can customize the size of widgets and put multiple
together if you like. Smart replies show up when someone messages you too—tap one of these AI-generated responses instead of
opening up the handset if you can't be distracted for more than a moment.
The cameras have been updated; the Flip6 has the same 50-megapixel main camera as the Galaxy S24 and an improved 12-megapixel
ultrawide. The Fold6 has these two plus a 12-megapixel camera with a 3X optical zoom. There's not much else new with the cameras,
except that Samsung has taken a cue from Motorola and added a feature called “Camcorder Grip” for the Flip6. Hold the phone
sideways, folded at a 90-degree angle like a camcorder, and it'll start recording, offering a zoom slider on the bottom screen as
you record. It's a fun feature on the Razr and I expect it to be the same here.
There are two other notable changes in this flip phone. First, Samsung says it has installed the first-ever vapor chamber in a
Galaxy Z Flip phone. These chambers are used on most smartphones today for better heat dissipation, allowing for smoother
sustained performance when playing games. That should make the Flip6 run cooler overall. Second, it now matches the Galaxy S24's
battery capacity at 4,000 mAh. Folding flip phones don't have great battery life, but every boost helps.
The Fold6 and Flip6 have some improvements to the Interpreter mode, which you use when translating a conversation IRL. There's a
Conversation mode and a Listening mode. The latter will let you run the mic as someone talks in another language, and you'll see
their speech translated as text on the screen. Conversation mode, on the other hand, lets you have a back-and-forth with someone,
showing text translations of your speech to the other person on the exterior screen, and the translation of their speech on the
internal screen. Google introduced this feature on its .
The Galaxy Z Flip6 and Z Fold6 are now available for preorder and go on sale July 24. The downside? There's a $100 price bump over
the last models, and it's difficult to stomach when the new phones are short on changes. The Galaxy Flip6 starts at $1,099, and
the Fold6 costs $1,900. Ouch. If it's any consolation, if you ever scratch the screen protector on either of these phones, you can
get a free replacement within one year from the date of purchase. If you crack the display, Samsung will offer a “reduced-free
screen repair” for $200, which is way cheaper than what you'd typically shell out. Just know this latter offer expires after two
years from purchase.
For the first time, there's a Galaxy Watch Ultra. I wonder this addition to the lineup? This is a big 47-mm Wear OS 5 smartwatch
and Samsung has a few new sporty watch faces to complete the look. It's made of titanium, has a 10 ATM water resistance, and can
operate in extreme altitudes like 500 meters below sea level up to 9,000 meters of elevation. (That's 29,527 feet—taller than
Mount Everest, so you can summit any peak on Earth with it.)
There's a new multi-sports tile if you want to track for a triathlon, a new capability that accurately measures maximum cycling
power within minutes, and an advanced personalized HR zone to ensure you're exerting the proper amount as you exercise. And then
there's a list of features Samsung more or less copied from Apple. Quick Button (aka Apple's ) lets you control workouts or you
can map it to other functions. There's an emergency siren to activate if things are perilous, and the screen will automatically
switch to Night mode (where everything is red) for the best readability in the dark. Speaking of, the screen also hits a peak
brightness of 3,000 nits.
A bigger watch means bigger battery life, and Samsung claims 100 hours in Power Saving mode and 48 hours in Exercise Power Saving
mode. It's hard to determine what that translates to in average use, but considering the Galaxy Watch6 series typically lasts a
day and a half, I expect the Ultra to last between two and three days. Brace yourself .
The standard Watch7 comes in two sizes (40 and 44 mm) and isn't much of a visual change from , though there are no more mechanical
rotating bezels on any of these smartwatches anymore. (Boo!) These watches are powered by a 3-nanometer processor that's faster
and more power efficient than the previous chips, and there's also dual-frequency GPS to better track your location.
Everything available on the Watch7 is available on the Watch Ultra, and the headline feature is FDA-authorized sleep apnea
tracking, which can monitor for moderate to severe signs of the condition. Many other health-tracking features are still available
but purportedly made better thanks to more accurate sensors in the watches; for example, heart rate measurements during intense
workouts are up to 30 percent more accurate, according to Samsung.
Samsung didn't dive into details about this in my meeting, but apparently the Watch7 is also capable of tracking advanced
glycation end products (AGEs) via an AGEs Index. This tool is supposed to help predict issues tied to metabolic health so you can
seek preventative care if warning signs are present.
The Galaxy Watch7 series starts at $300 and preorders are open now with official sales kicking off July 24.
Last but not least are the Galaxy Buds3 and Buds3 Pro—the first new Samsung wireless earbuds since 2022. Samsung says it spent 12
months collecting data to find the most comfortable fit and … well, I'm sorry to say that the answer turns out to be an AirPods
clone. No, really. They look like a Cybertruck had a baby with AirPods. The Buds3 have a flat design, but the Buds3 Pro have
eartips. They're both IP57-rated, so they're ready for sweaty runs.
The coolest trick these earbuds have up their sleeves is real-time translation via Samsung's Interpreter mode. It's powered by a
Galaxy Fold6 or Flip6, but the earbuds' mics can pick up anything said around you and translate it to your language. There's going
to be a small delay for the translations to trickle into your ears, so don't expect to follow fast talkers.
They have adaptive noise cancellation that can cut out blaring sirens or silence your music when someone starts talking to you,
and Samsung touts the usual audio improvements, like 24-bit 96-kHz playback and enhanced call quality. The Buds3 cost $180 and the
Buds3 Pro are $250. They're available for preorder now and go on sale July 24.

Welcome to the world of DeX.
Shopping for a new phone can be an ordeal. Let us take some of the pain out of it with these WIRED-tested picks and tips.
Tech companies are turning to controversial tactics to feed their data-hungry artificial intelligence models, vacuuming up , , ,
and posts, often unbeknownst to the creators.
AI companies are generally secretive about their sources of training data, but an investigation by Proof News found some of the
wealthiest AI companies in the world have used material from thousands of YouTube videos to train AI. Companies did so despite
YouTube’s rules against harvesting materials from the platform without permission.
Our investigation found that subtitles from 173,536 YouTube videos, siphoned from more than 48,000 channels, were used by Silicon
Valley heavyweights, including Anthropic, Nvidia, Apple, and Salesforce.
The dataset, called YouTube Subtitles, contains video transcripts from educational and online learning channels like Khan Academy,
MIT, and Harvard. The Wall Street Journal, NPR, and the BBC also had their videos used to train AI, as did The Late Show With
Stephen Colbert, Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, and Jimmy Kimmel Live.
Proof News also found material from YouTube megastars, including (289 million subscribers, two videos taken for training)
Proof News created a to search for creators in the YouTube AI training dataset.
than 2 million subscribers and more than 2 billion views. Nearly 160 of his videos were swept up into the YouTube Subtitles
training dataset.
Four people work full time on Pakman’s enterprise, which posts multiple videos each day in addition to producing a podcast, TikTok
videos, and material for other platforms. If AI companies are paid, Pakman said, he should be compensated for the use of his data.
He pointed out that some media companies have recently penned agreements to be paid for use of their work to train AI.
their work taken from YouTube to train AI.
Wiskus said it’s “disrespectful” to use creators’ work without their consent, especially since studios may use “generative AI to
replace as many of the artists along the way as they can.”
Representatives at EleutherAI, the creators of the dataset, did not respond to requests for comment on Proof’s findings, including
allegations that videos were used without permission. The company’s states its overall goal is to lower the barriers to AI
development to those outside the gilded walls of Big Tech, and it has historically provided “access to cutting‑edge AI
YouTube Subtitles does not include video imagery but consists of plain text of videos’ subtitles, often along with translations
into languages including Japanese, German, and Arabic.
According to a published by EleutherAI, the dataset is part of a compilation the nonprofit released called the Pile. The
developers of the Pile included material from not just YouTube but also the European Parliament, English Wikipedia, and a trove of
Enron Corporation that was released as part of a federal investigation into the firm.
Most of the Pile’s datasets are accessible and open for anyone on the internet with enough space and computing power to access
them. Academics and other developers outside of Big Tech made use of the dataset, but they weren’t the only ones.
they used the Pile to train AI. Documents also show Apple used the Pile to train OpenELM, a high-profile model released in April,
weeks before the company revealed it will add new AI capabilities to iPhones and MacBooks. and also trained models on the Pile,
the companies’ publications indicate.
So too did , a leading AI maker that garnered a $4 billion investment from Amazon and promotes its focus on “AI safety.”
confirming use of the Pile in Anthropic’s generative AI assistant Claude. “YouTube’s terms cover direct use of its platform, which
is distinct from use of the Pile dataset. On the point about potential violations of YouTube’s terms of service, we’d have to
Salesforce also confirmed use of the Pile to build an AI model for “academic and research purposes.” Caiming Xiong, the vice
president of AI research at the company, emphasized in a statement that the dataset was “publicly available.”
Salesforce later released that same AI model for public use in 2022, and it has since been downloaded at least 86,000 times,
according to its page. In their research paper, Salesforce developers that the Pile also contained profanity as well as “biases
against gender and certain religious groups” and warned that could lead to “vulnerabilities and safety concerns.” Proof News found
thousands of examples of profanity in YouTube Subtitles as well as instances of racial and gender slurs. Salesforce’s
representative did not respond to questions about safety concerns.
A representative for Nvidia declined to comment. Apple, Databricks, and Bloomberg representatives did not respond to requests for
comment.
AI companies compete against each other, in part by procuring higher-quality data, said Jai Vipra, an AI policy researcher and
CyberBRICS fellow at Fundação Getulio Vargas Law School, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It’s one of the reasons companies keep sources
of data close to the vest.
Earlier this year, reported that Google, which owns YouTube, tapped videos on the platform for text to train its models. In
response, a spokesperson told the paper its use was permitted under agreements with YouTube creators.
The Times’ investigation also found OpenAI used YouTube videos without authorization. Company representatives neither confirmed
nor denied the paper’s findings.
OpenAI executives have repeatedly declined to publicly answer questions about whether it used YouTube videos to train its AI
product Sora, which creates videos from text prompts. Earlier this year, a reporter with put the question to Mira Murati, OpenAI’s
chief technology officer.
YouTube Subtitles and other types of speech to text data are potentially a “gold mine,” Vipra said, because they can help train
models to replicate how people talk and converse.
and other science tutorials has 3 million subscribers and had 140 videos lifted for YouTube Subtitles.
then there needs to be a conversation on the table about compensation or some kind of regulation,” he said.
YouTube Subtitles, which was published in 2020, also contains subtitles from more than 12,000 videos that have since been deleted
from YouTube. In at least one case, the creator deleted their entire online presence, yet that work has been incorporated into an
unknown number of AI models.
Proof News attempted to reach the owners of channels named in this story. Many did not respond to requests for comment. Of the
creators we spoke to, none were aware that their information had been taken, much less of how it was used.
Among those surprised: the producers of (nearly 16 million subscribers, 871 videos taken) and (8 million subscribers, 228 videos
taken), which are pillars of brothers’ Hank and John Green’s educational video empire.
Julie Walsh Smith, the CEO of the shows’ production company, Complexly, said in a statement.
YouTube Subtitles isn’t the first set of AI training data to trouble creative industries.
Proof News contributor Alex Reisner obtained a copy of Books3, another Pile dataset, and last year published a piece in The
Atlantic reporting his finding that , including those written by Margaret Atwood, Michael Pollan, and Zadie Smith, had been
lifted. Many authors have since for the unauthorized use of their work and alleged copyright violations. Similar cases have since
snowballed, and the platform hosting Books3 has taken it down.
In response to the suits, defendants such as , and have argued that their actions constitute fair use. A case against EleutherAI,
which originally scraped the books and made them public, was voluntarily .
Litigation in remaining cases remains in the early stages, leaving the questions surrounding permission and payment unresolved.
The Pile has since been removed from its official download site, but it’s still available on file-sharing services.
who has brought lawsuits on behalf of creatives whose work was allegedly scooped up by AI firms without their consent.
Many creators feel uncertain about the path ahead.
Full-time YouTubers patrol for unauthorized use of their work, regularly filing takedown notices, and some worry it’s only a
matter of time before AI can generate content similar to what they make—if not produce outright copycats.
Pakman, the creator of The David Pakman Show, saw the power of AI recently while scrolling on TikTok. He came across a video that
was labeled as a Tucker Carlson clip, but when Pakman watched it, he was taken aback. It sounded like Carlson but was, word for
word, what Pakman had said on his YouTube show, down to the cadence. He was equally alarmed that only one of the video’s
commenters seemed to recognize that it was fake—a voice clone of Carlson reading Pakman’s script.
EleutherAI cofounder Sid Black on GitHub that he created YouTube Subtitles by using a script. That script downloads the subtitles
from YouTube’s API in the same way a YouTube viewer’s browser downloads them when watching a video. According to documentation on
GitHub, Black used 495 search terms to cull videos, including “funny vloggers,” “Einstein,” “black protestant,” “Protective Social
Services,” “infowars,” “quantum chromodynamics,” “Ben Shapiro,” “Uighurs,” “fruitarian,” “cake recipe,” ”Nazca lines,” and “flat

In an email to Proof News, Depoix said he hasn’t used the code since he wrote it as a university student for a project several
years ago and was surprised people found it useful. He declined to answer questions about YouTube’s rules.
Google spokesperson Jack Malon said in an email response to a request for comment that the company has taken “action over the
years to prevent abusive, unauthorized scraping.” He did not respond to questions about other companies’ use of the material as
training data.
Among the videos used by AI companies are 146 from Einstein Parrot, a channel with nearly 150,000 subscribers. The African grey’s
caretaker, Marcia, who didn’t want to use her last name for fear of endangering the famous bird’s safety, said at first she

Acer's Chromebook Plus 514 () is one of our favorites out of the recent crop of new, more powerful Chromebooks. It's everything
you need for everyday tasks like browsing the web, editing documents, and chatting with friends. The keyboard and trackpad are
excellent, which is unusual for a Chromebook, and the touch display feels great. It's not going to win any design awards, and
there's no backlit keyboard, but this is a lot of laptop for the price.
This is our for phones, with storage that tops out at 256 GB. It has both a Lightning plug for and and a USB-C plug for and , so
you can use it to transfer files for a wide range of gadgets. It’s worth noting that if you want to use it with an iPhone or iPad,
you’ll have to install the . It’s not the fastest drive (90 MB/s read, 35 MB/s write) but it works well—it took a couple of hours
to back up photos from an iPhone. In terms of design, it’s slim and the metal casing has a loop for a keychain. But one plug is
always exposed, so SanDisk provides a separate plastic cover that slots on—you’ll have to be careful not to lose it. —Brenda
Logitech makes a lot of great, functional keyboards, but the Pop Keys () not only leverage the company’s excellent peripheral
design, they also look fun. The Pop Keys come in a variety of vibrant color palettes, with cute circular key tops that are
comfortable and feel distinct to type on. There’s a row of customizable dedicated emoji keys along the right side that you can
swap out with your favorite or most commonly used emoji. It’s a distinct design that can make your desk feel less dreary and more
engaging. Best of all, even on a normal day, the Pop Keys are , which makes this sale an even better time to buy. —Eric
There are few upgrades for your gaming PC that will be quite as good for your rig as a new graphics card. The 4060 line of Nvidia
cards are solid entry-level GPUs in the recent 40XX line, and given the chaotic nature of the GPU market, we take notice of even
slight sales on these cards. This line can tackle all those modern ray-tracing features that make every puddle on the sidewalk

aluminum and comes with an array of cardioid patterns so you can use it for a single source, for two speakers facing each other,
or to pick up ambient sound in a room. It connects via USB so you don’t need all the complicated . —Eric Ravenscraft
Tile Stickers are the for remotes, Kindle readers, and other small, frequently misplaced objects. Each tracker is waterproof and
has a three-year battery life. The 150-foot range means you won’t want to use these to track your phone or wallet, but for beloved
stuffed animals or your mobile gaming controller, Tile Stickers are worth a gander. If you lose your tracked thing, simply pop
open the app and track the sticker’s location. It doesn’t get much easier than that. —Louryn Strampe
Did you know iPhones can for your MacBook? It’s a relatively new feature called Continuity Camera and a very seamless process to
get it all going. But where do you put your iPhone while webcamming? Enter this Belkin mount. It magnetically sticks to the back
of the and a little lip sticks out where you can hang it over your MacBook screen. When you’re not teleconferencing, you can use
the mount as a kickstand or phone grip. —Julian Chokkattu
Need a printer? This one will do the job just fine. It’s the printer I’ve and was quick to connect to my Wi-Fi and set up. The
print quality is solid, and swapping out the ink is easy. It’s a color printer and has an NFC sensor so you can tap the back of
your phone to send a document to print. —Julian Chokkattu
With Wi-Fi 7 support still thin on the ground and prices of Wi-Fi 6E mesh systems falling, this could be a great way to try out
the newly opened 6-GHz band. This tri-band mesh sports TP-Link’s usual vaselike Deco design and a two-pack is relatively
affordable. It in my tests, but the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul by default and has limited range. Basic features
are free, but beefed-up Security+ costs $5 a month or $36 a year, and Advanced Parental Controls require a second subscription
costing $3 a month or $18 a year. —Simon Hill
For folks with large homes, Netgear’s Orbi offer some of the widest coverage available. This tri-band, Wi-Fi 6 mesh boasts two
apiece. Netgear’s app is very straightforward, but you must splash out on subscriptions if you want more than basic security and
parental controls. Large properties with relatively modest needs, up to 40 devices, and 1 Gbps internet connections will be well
I love mounting everything. Monitor? Put it on a monitor arm mount and save desk space. Lamp? Put it on a clamp and mount it to
your desk! Lume Cube’s desk light clamps easily and can help brighten up your desk or even your face during video calls. You get
options to tweak the color temperature and brightness. I’ve been using it for more than a year with no issues. —Julian Chokkattu
This tiny little PNY flash drive is our top pick for compact portable storage in our guide. With support for USB 3.2 Gen 2 (), it
can handle large files with blisteringly fast speeds. PNY claims that read speeds up to 600 MB/s and write speeds up to 250 MB/s,
but in my own testing, it gets far beyond that. In fact, it’s so fast that I use it when testing , and routinely get both read and
write speeds in excess of 800 MB/s. Your mileage may vary, depending on the connectors on your laptop or any adapters you use, but
if it’s fast enough to use as a baseline for my testing the transfer of massive media files, there’s a good chance it’s plenty
fast for anything you can throw at it. —Eric Ravenscraft
Sonos-enabled turntables might seem stupid to audio purists but they're actually quite handy when it comes to playing your
favorite records around the house. That's why we're fans of this medium-end model from Victrola (). It’s a decent enough
standalone deck, but the Sonos connectivity is what makes it worth a little more than similar models, even on Prime Day. —Parker
Google’s Pixel Tablet and Charging Stand () does a great job of marrying tablet and a smart display into one. The future of smart
displays is using the screens you already have, after all, and this handy combo gives you a full-fledged Android tablet that turns
into a solid smart display when you aren’t using it. It does a good job being both things, too, which can be rare for combination
devices, and the dock speakers are robust and loud enough to fill a room with music. And as someone who often forgets to charge
her tablet, having a dedicated space to easily charge it between uses (and never wonder where I left it, either!) is crazy
Simplicity is attractive for many folks, and when it comes to Wi-Fi we all just want a stable, speedy connection that works. The
Google Nest Wifi Pro () is one of the easiest and I have ever tested. It may lack some bells and whistles, but if you prefer to
remain hands-off with your tech, this is the mesh system for you. This tri-band system opens up the 6-GHz band, but it is mostly
reserved for backhaul (sending traffic between the main router and nodes). The cute design blends in easily, the Nest Wifi Pro
offers decent performance, is very easy to set up in the Google Home app, and includes smart home extras like Matter and Thread
The Google Nest Cam is our recommendation for if Google runs your house, and the Google Nest Cam with Floodlight is perfect to add
to areas where you want a floodlight to boost your security. There are three hours of free event history, or you can add on the
Nest Aware subscription ($8 a month, or $80 for the whole year) to get 30 days of event history and have the camera identify faces
it sees. It captures sharp 1080p video with HDR and night vision, has a clear speaker and microphone, and the motion detection is
With an understated design, Google’s Nest Cam is a wired indoor security camera that records clear 1080p video thanks to HDR and a
relatively high frame rate (30 fps). It also supports two-way audio, night vision kicks on automatically when the lights go out,
and notifications come through swiftly and reliably. The catch is you need a Nest Aware subscription at $8 per month ($80/year) to
get 30 days of event video history and smart features, like familiar face alerts. On the plus side, that subscription covers all
of your Nest devices. If you can stomach the cost, this is my . Face recognition is very handy, as notifications tell me when the
kids or my wife come home and instantly flag strangers. —Simon Hill
Security cameras with floodlights attached are a great way to secure areas like your garage or backyard. Motion will trigger the
light and a video recording, and the camera can record color footage because the area is illuminated. The E340 is a dual-lens
camera with a 3K wide angle lens and a 2K telephoto lens for up to 8x zoom to capture details up to 50 feet away. Two adjustable
light panels can put out up to 2,000 lumens. It can also pan 360 degrees and tilt 120 degrees, record locally to a microSD card up
to 128 GB, or connect to a HomeBase 3 (both sold separately). This is one of the and an excellent choice for folks seeking a
This versatile device is the pan-and-tilt pick in our guide. It’s ideal if you want a hands-off camera you can set up and leave to
do its thing. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that
boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3X zoom in the center of the
frame (it goes up to 8x hybrid zoom). There’s also 8 GB of storage built in to keep things local. The relatively low 15 fps frame
rate is disappointing, and the two-way audio quality is not great, but there is onboard AI and subject tracking. —Simon Hill
This relatively affordable camera can record video at up to 2K and 30 frames per second, boasts a 150-degree field of view, and
connects directly to your Wi-Fi network. The Tapo app categorizes motion (person, pet, vehicle) and allows you to set activity
zones and privacy zones. The two-way audio is okay, and there’s a built-in alarm function. You can also slip a microSD card in for
local recording or opt for a Tapo Care subscription (from $3.50/month or $35/year) for 30-day video cloud storage. All that’s
really lacking here is HDR, and this excellent device was runner-up in our guide. —Simon Hill
We love a lot of Nomad gear here at WIRED. Right now, the company's anniversary sale is going on and it'll last a few more days.

If you want to cool a small space like a tent, RV, or even a small bedroom, the EcoFlow Wave 2 () is a portable AC unit rated at
air conditioning, and it did enough to keep things comfortable. It is portable, though heavy, especially with the add-on battery.
If you can’t plug in, the battery adds up to eight hours of cooling on eco mode. The app is slick, and the Wave 2 is relatively
quiet in operation, delivering effective off-grid cooling or heating (6100 BTU) that you can take with you. But it is pricey, even
I discovered this fan looking for an easier way to , and it is awesome for blowing dust out of just about anything. It works much
like compressed air for clearing dust and debris from keyboards and computers, but it doesn’t run out. You can set the intensity
with a sliding switch, and it charges via USB-C when the battery is low. It also comes with wee attachments that make it truly
versatile. I’ve used it for detailing the car, blowing crumbs out of the couch, and for dusting everywhere. —Simon Hill
As many of my coworkers have noted, I live in Portland, Oregon, the city with the purest, finest-tasting water in all the land.
This means that I love Lifestraw, because whenever my children and I have to drink water anywhere else in the world, we end up
gagging. I love all of Lifestraw’s products; I use the when we travel, and have recently replaced it with the attractive . But the
most affordable is the personal water filter. Not only does it remove waterborne bacteria and parasites, it also removes
microplastics. Each filter can clean up to 1,000 gallons of water before it needs to be replaced. Even if you don’t normally
venture into life-threatening situations, it’s lightweight and affordable for when you’re traveling in countries where you need to
filter water to brush your teeth, or even just for when your 7-year-old dehydrates himself just because he doesn’t like the taste.

The Tushy Classic 3.0 is a pretty low key bidet. While it doesn’t have some of the bells and whistles other bidets have, the Tushy
Classic is easy to install, doesn’t require external power, and is safe to use in a rental or home where you can’t make major
changes. My husband and I love ours—we used my impending birth as an excuse to buy bidets for all our bathrooms, so that way I
wouldn’t need to have a peri bottle handy (postpartum problems). It’s been a great addition to our home long after giving birth,
and they were easy to uninstall from our rental and bring to our new condo, too. I love the bamboo knob finish, but there are tons
of colors to make sure it matches your bathroom’s vibes. —Nena Farrell
I’m obsessed with smart bird feeders and have tried a few for an upcoming WIRED guide. Bird Buddy’s feeder () is cute and compact
if you’re limited on outdoor space. The connected app snaps pictures of your visitors, using AI to identify the species. I didn’t
try this solar roof version, but I would recommend it to eliminate the need to constantly charge the camera. If you don’t mind it,
or you have another solar charger already, the . —Medea Giordano
Clip the on-page coupon to get an additional 15 percent off. This is another great option and it’s bigger with a nice perch, so
you could potentially get more visitors at once. It’s also more affordable and comes with a lifetime AI subscription so you won’t
have to pay a monthly fee. If you skip the AI, you can get the , and you’ll get video only with the option to add a subscription
later. Since we’ve tested both the Birdfy and Bird Buddy, both AI identification processes have improved and will continue to
Casper is the company that brought bed-in-a-box mattresses to prominence stateside, and the Original was the company’s signature
mattress for most of the era. The Original was a mainstay on our guide to the until the launch of the new One, which is now
overall. The Original is still a very solid pick if you’re looking to nab a queen-sized hybrid for just over a grand during Prime
Day. Unlike many of our picks, it’s sold via Amazon if you want fast and free Prime delivery. Depending on where you live, you
could order now and be sleeping on it tomorrow night. —Martin Cizmar
If you prefer to work from your couch or your bed, this rollable table is perfect for your extra-comfy setup. The C-shaped design
makes it easy to slot next to your bed or your couch without having to sit on the edge of the cushions or get stuck on pesky legs.
The height is adjustable, too, using a gas spring up to 40.5 inches. It's on sale right now if you've been hemming and hawing
I love grabbing this robe right out of the shower, sometimes even in place of a real towel. The super-plush descriptor is
accurate—this robe is fluffy and cozy, and makes me feel like I’m at a spa resort when I’m really just washing sand out of my hair
after visiting the beach with my toddler. But Brooklinen’s robe isn’t so warm that it’s been too hot to use on summer nights, and
these days I just do a light towel dry before slipping on the robe and letting the robe do the rest of the work. It stays fluffy
after a wash, and while it does shed a little, it’s not much compared to other fluffy towels I’ve tried. I love wearing the
Brooklinen robe while I or wear a before bed, and I am resisting the temptation to add the Resort Stripe color to my collection.
Water can cause serious damage, so you want to be immediately alerted when there’s a leak so you can deal with it. The versatile
Moen Flo is one the , offering swift and reliable alerts by email, push notification, and text message. It also has a built-in
alarm and flashing LED. The metal feet alert when water rises, and there’s a disc sensor with a lengthy cable if you prefer to
wall mount. This detector also provides temperature and humidity readings via the companion app. —Simon Hill
Automation is what makes a smart home feel smart, and Switchbot’s clever automatic curtain opener, now in its third iteration, is
a retrofit solution to open and close your drapes. Easy to install, with built-in solar panels to keep the battery topped off,
these curtain openers have a “QuietDrift” mode that keeps the noise down. Pair with a Switchbot hub, and you open up full smart
home connectivity. All the flaws of the original Curtain Bot () and Curtain Rod 2 () were fixed in Switchbot Curtain 3, and it

Casper is known for its mattresses, but the company makes a sleek we love with an intuitive design. To start the sunset program
before you go to bed, simply flip the Casper Glow Light over and ta-da! It begins. You’ll use the app to set up details for your
sunset and your sunrise too, such as the length of time for the light to increase or decrease. The sleek little light has dimming
controls, but only one shade of gorgeously yellow light that does a great job evenly lighting a dark room. The Casper Glow Light
is wireless, which is rare, and recharges on a pad the size of a coaster. It’s a chic option if you want great light, a consistent
The LectroFan Classic is for most people, particularly if you just want a few options of colored noise and fan sounds. It’s simply
constructed, with big buttons that are easy to navigate in the dark, and a 60-minute timer. —Medea Giordano
If you are looking to get started with , this smart light starter kit from is a great way to do it. You get three bulbs, a smart
button switch to control them with, and a hub to connect these and future Philips Hue devices. Control options include voice
assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant, but you can also automate these lights, change the color, brightness, and temperature,
and create scenes in the Hue app on your phone. This is the best deal we've seen in a while for this kit, so it’s a good time to
Govee’s Neon Rope Light Strip 2 is one of . It’s gorgeous enough to use as both art and light on just about any wall, without
needing to tuck it behind a TV or console of some kind. Use it to create fun shapes and designs with the help of adhesive-backed
metal brackets (or use the included screws) and bendable clips, and it’s more flexible than the original version to make it easier
to make your cool wall designs. The Neon Rope Light 2 works with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Matter, allowing you to
connect it with Apple HomeKit and Samsung SmartThings via Matter. —Nena Farrell
Like most robot vacuum manufacturers these days, Roborock has a truly bewildering array of offerings at various price points and
with different features. The Q Revo line is the company’s midrange line, with slightly less suction (7000 Pa) versus the high-end
SQ MaxV Ultra at 10,000 Pa. The Q Revo S is the update to last year’s Q Revo, which I tested and has slightly less suction at 5000
Pa. However, in my testing, after about 5000 Pa it doesn’t make a huge difference and depending on how often you vacuum, you might
end up just balding your carpets. Altogether, there isn’t a ton of differences in the Q Revo line versus Yeedi’s at this point;
they have the same lidar navigation system, and the apps even look very similar. The Q Revo S doesn’t have an extendable arm, and
the base is a few inches taller than the Yeedi, if you plan on sticking it under a convenient shelf. However, it is on sale for
cheaper than Yeedi’s high-end vac and overall I have found the Q Revo to be a reliable, if a bit noisy, cleaning partner.
The Yeedi M12 Pro+ is the high end of Yeedi’s product line. Like Roborock before it, I have been shocked by the improvement in
Yeedi’s software and hardware over the past few years. The cleaning station has a new sleek look and is remarkably compact,
considering that it comes with a self-emptying dust bin and two huge, 4-liter water tanks—one for clean water, and one for dirty.
The helpful but still creepy extendable arm reaches into every nook and cranny to mop, and the dock now has a hot air dryer so
that the mop pads don’t get moldy. After several weeks, I even sniffed them to see and they still smelled clean (the things we do
for testing). You can even start a cleaning session by tapping the bumper with your foot, although with a new puppy in the house
this is not as convenient a feature as you might think. I genuinely regret to say that getting a premium robot vacuum mop for
under $800 is a steal in this economy. If you’re in the tax bracket that’s considering hiring a house cleaner, this is a purchase
that will help you put off that decision for a little longer. —Adrienne So
Last year’s T9+ () was the midrange option in Ecovacs’ Deebot lineup, so at $370 this is a bit of a steal. A year on, it still has
two unique features that recommend it. First, it does not use cameras to navigate, instead relying on lasers for its TrueDetect 3D
mysterious photos of your butt as you walk around changing won’t ever appear on the internet. Second, it has an air freshener, and
I found the artificial fragrances to be a very subtle pick-me-up. You will have to replace the disposable mopping pads more
frequently than a slightly more high-end mop-vac though. —Adrienne So
One of the , the Eufy S350 is incredibly versatile, though it is likely overkill for most folks. This dual-lens camera combines a
regular 4K camera with a 130-degree field of view with a 2K telephoto lens that supports 3x optical zoom. You can pan 360 degrees
and tilt 75 degrees. There is also AI tracking with up to four preset positions it can patrol, privacy mode, two-way audio, and
onboard AI to detect people, pets, and sounds. You can record locally with a microSD card up to 128 GB or HomeBase 3 (both sold
separately). The relatively low frame rate (15) and sometimes slow-loading feed take the shine off a little, but it’s pretty
capable, and we have never seen it below $100 before. —Simon Hill
Eufy pioneered the dual camera design for video doorbells, enabling you to see visitors and packages on your doorstep by offering
a split view or combining the two lenses into a single view of your entire porch. The E340 is the right now. It is an improved
version of the original Eufy Video Doorbell Dual () and does not need a hub (it has 8 GB of internal storage). The 2K footage is
generally crisp and clear, and the onboard AI detects people and packages (it can even recognize faces, though not always
accurately). It is discounted often, but we have never seen it this low. —Simon Hill
With a self-emptying bin, smart AI navigation, and mopping capability, the Eufy X10 Pro Omni () is a great choice for busy family
homes. It can handle multiple floors, recognizes and avoids obstacles, and is very good at mopping hard floors, according to WIRED
editor Adrienne So. Emptying the water tank is never fun, but at least you don’t have to do it very often. The X10 Pro Omni made
our guide as the best affordable vacuum mop. The lowest price we have seen previously was $680, so this is a good discount. —Simon
The Dreame X30 Ultra has been dragged from my carpet-covered apartment to my vinyl-planked condo, and it has done an amazing job
in both places whether it's vacuuming or mopping. The coolest trick it has, and the reason behind the steep price tag, is that it
can remove its own mop pads when it goes to vacuum carpet or a rug so that it doesn't drag the damp pads all over your fabric
flooring of choice. It can also just raise up the mop pads, but I'd prefer to keep my mop water away from my white rug, thank you
very much, and the X30 makes that possible. It's a serious splurge, but it's got a great discount for Prime Day. —Nena Farrell
If you have cats, you know that their bathroom habits are important to monitor to catch signs of potential illnesses (some of
which can be quickly fatal). I love the Petivity (), which sits underneath any standard litter box and, through the connected app,
tells me which cat went to the bathroom when, what they did, and how much they weigh. I get some peace of mind knowing I have one
I’ve now tried around a dozen brands and none have come close to beating the quality and ease of use of Aura. The screens simply
look the best—photos are high quality but not overly shiny like they look on an iPad or smart display—and the app is polished and
easy to navigate and share with family members. The is our top recommendation because it’s also the most affordable from the
brand, but this version of the Carver has a mat border if you prefer that style. —Medea Giordano
I wasn’t always a percale fan, but after trying out percale sheets in the summertime, they’ve become one of my go-to .
Brooklinen’s percale is my personal favorite, as their percale is crisp and light, allowing for lots of airflow, but still
slightly soft and not overly papery to the touch.. I especially love all the beautiful colors it comes in, and you can get the
brand’s percale in a duvet cover too if you want a more breathable top layer. Brooklinen’s running a surprise sale on their site,
so even though you can find Brooklinen on Amazon, you’ll actually want to go to Brooklinen’s site to find their Prime Day deals.
This stroller just arrived at my home to test for our guide to strollers. I was intrigued by the cargo mode that lets the sides
fold down flat to cart things around, or you can also lower the sides to make it easier for your bossy toddler (don’t mind me
projecting here) to get out on his own, because he absolutely does not want your help. You also fold it down flat to store it,
reminding me of what I like about the more expensive Veer wagon. Will it unseat the Veer for me? I’m not sure yet, but if you want
something similar to a Veer without paying Veer prices, this is the closest I’ve found but with way more built-in storage. —Nena
The CubiAi is one of our . It has great in-depth detection, and can send you alerts not only if it sees a baby move, but can also
detect when your baby's face is covered with a blanket (and just a reminder, they should be at least a year old before a blanket
is in the crib with them!) or if the baby has rolled over, which you’ll want to fix immediately if your little one isn’t strong
enough to lift their head up. But my favorite part is how the CuboAi Plus is designed to look like a little bird, and can even
make some bird-chirping alert sounds–a fun addition for any nursery. It’s on sale on both Cubo’s site and Amazon’s, but the price
is better if you go to Cubo’s own site. —Nena Farrell
If you’ve got a , this is an easy way to prep fruits and vegetables—even if there’s minimal prep space. This food processor has a
or pesto, and all of the pieces are dishwasher safe. If you’re making a big batch of something, you might need to do a few rounds
of processing, but the trade-off is worthwhile when working in small spaces. —Louryn Strampe
Stasher bags are some of the out there. Rather than using individual plastic disposable bags, you can use these dishwasher- and
microwave-safe resealable versions again and again. A , but this starter kit would be good if you want to snag multiple sizes.
You’ll get six different bags ranging from tiny snack bags all the way to a half-gallon one. And the colors are cute! —Louryn
regularly jumps between $200 and $130, but we haven’t seen it drop lower than $130 since Black Friday 2023. It’s not just an air
fryer—the Ninja Speedi has other functions too, like searing, sauteing, roasting, baking, and more. There’s even a sous-vide
function. Our tester especially liked this appliance’s efficient use of space. You can adjust the inner rack to cook a grain on
the bottom and roast meat on the top, and the compact overall design means it won’t take up too much space on your countertop.
The , Breville’s Barista Express produces consistent pressure for espresso, steams milk with an easily adjustable steam wand, and
even grinds beans for you. It’s a coffee shop on your counter. Just like its more expensive siblings (we also like the ), the
Barista Express builds up water pressure gradually, ensuring a smooth and even extraction. Its sturdy, mostly-metal construction
and easy cleaning have also helped make it a popular choice for several years now and a longtime favorite of ours. WIRED reviews
editor Julian Chokkattu has been using one with no issues for five years. —Scott Gilbertson
The Café Barista is a downgraded version of our favorite espresso machine, the Mr. Coffee One-Touch Coffeehouse. The Barista is
better for those who want a machine that mixes the milk for you without much fuss. It cranks out fairly rich single or double-size
espressos, cappuccinos, and lattes with the push of a button. The downside is that this one is more plasticky and lightweight then
higher priced machines, which means you really have to steady the machine with your hand as you twist the portafilter into place.
Oxo’s Brew grinder is our top budget grinder. It has a good balance of features, usefulness, and a relatively low price among the
electric grinders we’ve tested. It’s a conical burr grinder, so it gives you the precision for most types of brewing. There are 15
settings, covering every brewing scenario from finely ground espresso to coarse-ground that’s perfect for a French press. Its
slim, narrow profile doesn’t hog counter space—though it is 16 inches tall and might be a tight fit under the cabinets. —Scott
Breville’s Barista Touch includes a built-in burr grinder, a hot water spout, and a digital display. It’s aimed at the home
barista who wants to program in their own custom drinks and access them at the touch of a button. With the Barista Touch, you can
just hit the Latte button and have it whip up a latte. It’ll even foam the milk—not as well as you can do it manually, but it’s a
The Remington Shine Therapy is one of the . As the name suggests, it’s fantastic for shine. The barrel is made from keratin- and
argan-oil-infused ceramic, so it helps keep your hair looking glossy and smooth. There are 10 different heat settings and you’ll
get a heat glove to assist in the curling process. The handle is large, too, which will help prevent cramps if you’re curling long
I impulsively bought this after seeing it go on sale during every major shopping holiday. But reader, let me tell you—the
curiosity paid off. I love this lip mask so much. I could write a book about it. It lasts forever—I’m still using my original tub
that I bought almost two years ago. The balm is rich and moisturizing, and it’s not overly sticky since it melts down quickly. I
keep it on my nightstand and take it with me when I travel anywhere. It’s especially nice in the winter or when traveling via air,
or after an event when I’m taking off my mask. My lips have never been smoother or more supple. The consistency is super
luxurious, the scents and flavors are light, and there’s no tint. My only complaint is that it’s easy to lose the tiny included
spatula. If fingers in your product tubs bother you, consider purchasing a . —Louryn Strampe
A roommate in college used Paul Mitchell’s Express Ion Style+ Ceramic Flat Iron on my hair and changed my life. Until then, I’d
never used a good iron and always had so-so results. After, I had hair that literally looked a different texture with actual body
and life. The Style+ is still . It’s been updated since I first tried it, notably with a digital screen for setting the
temperature—it’s better to be accurate than having to guesstimate with a temperature dial. I’ve seen it work on multiple hair
textures and curl patterns, so if you’ve always struggled, go with this one. —Medea Giordano
The Tymo Ring was a social media sensation at its release, and it . It combines a straightening brush with a traditional hot comb,
with an outer shell that helps you straighten hair close to the roots without accidentally putting the hot plate directly on your
scalp. It took the curl right out of my hair in one to two passes. I had to use a quick pass of a flat iron to tame the poof, but
softer hair textures will likely not need that extra step. We haven’t tried the newer . If it’s also discounted, it might be worth
the upgrade, but it’s similar enough that you may not see a difference in use. —Medea Giordano
There was a time when wet-to-dry would make me shudder, bringing back 2000s memories of crispy, frying hair. Dyson,
unsurprisingly, figured out how to do it right. The of WIRED writer Brenda Stolyar. It uses hot air to dry and straighten hair,
with the tension you’d find in a traditional flat iron but without the need for those hot plates so there’s much less direct heat
Not everything should cost as much as your grocery order. There are a ton of great, pricey that we love, but Remington’s Shine
Therapy Straightener outperforms many of them. It heats up quickly and I didn’t have to repeatedly go over a section of hair to
get it straight (or curled!). You get the desired result without overheating it. While my coarse curls are never quite silky, my
hair didn’t look crispy either—a win in my book. It also has an LED display, which isn’t always the norm at this price. —Medea
The Braun Series 9 is . Our tester notes that the quality of accessories is well above average, and if you’re paranoid that you
might change settings while shaving your face, this trimmer is equipped with two safety measures. The control dial would be hard
enough on its own to accidentally change it while holding it, but a switch locks that dial in place so you get a clean, consistent
This makes our list of for its luxury finishes. It’s not the most expensive of our favorites, but it still trades out plastic for
hefty metal that feels substantial in your hand. The bottom is sturdy enough to let it stand on its own, too, without a separate
piece keeping it steady. Our tester found that the steel blade system was a bit harsh on his skin over plastic, though. —Medea
Therabody makes some of , and the Sense is a reasonably priced option (for the brand, at least). It’s nearly silent, so you can
use it at home, the gym, or maybe even at the office without annoying everyone around you. It has an LCD screen for controls and
guided routines, and a breathwork feature with a heart rate monitor—you can find these in the very expensive too. The Sense has
three fewer attachments than the Pro Plus, but most people won’t need all that excess. The pared-down Theragun Relief is even
cheaper, but is only available from and . —Medea Giordano
Therabody’s massage guns are its most popular recovery items, but I love the band’s Smart Goggles (). A combination of vibration,
massage, and heat ease away eye pain and headaches, or simply give you 20 minutes of relaxation anytime you need it. It’s a pricey
accessory, but if you suffer from frequent headaches like I do, it could be worth the money, especially on sale. —Medea Giordano
I’m not the biggest fan of Apple’s standard AirPods (), but they do work impeccably well with iPhones, iPads, and other Apple
products, and some folks find them to be just about the only earbuds that fit in their ears (looking at you, reviewer Martin
Cizmar). This is the cheapest they usually get, so now is a great time to buy them. —Parker Hall
The 1st-Gen Apple Pencil has been around for almost a decade, but it still works well. It’s also compatible with a handful of
iPads including the base model (6th-Gen and later) iPad Mini (5th-Gen), iPad Air (3rd-Gen) iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st- and 2nd-Gen),
iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad Pro 9.7-inch. It comes with various features too, including tilt sensitivity (for shading), pressure
sensitivity (where the lines get thicker as you press harder on the display), and handwriting support within search fields and
apps (like Notes). It dips to this price frequently, but we still think it’s a solid deal. —Brenda Stolyar
AirTags are our favorite for iPhone users. They’re about the size of a quarter, and Apple offers a variety of that allow you to
attach them to everything, including keys, bags, pet collars, and more. In addition to Bluetooth, it also uses Apple’s U1
location-finding chip that helps you pinpoint your item’s exact location via the Find My app. Using the app, you can walk around
with your phone, and, using the phone’s accelerometer, gyroscope, and camera, it’ll direct you right toward the missing item. The
Find My network, while giant, is also anonymous and end-to-end encrypted. —Brenda Stolyar
The M2-powered iPad Air () came out only two months ago, but it’s already on sale. I love the new 13-inch solely for its bigger
and brighter display. I’ve been using it as a secondary display to work off of during the day and watch TV before bed—both of
which make for great viewing experiences. Under the hood is an M2 processor, which is the same one that powers the 13-inch Macbook
Air and MacBook Pro from 2022. Equipped with an 8-core CPU and 9-core GPU, Apple claims it’s 50 percent faster than the M1-powered
version. I didn’t notice a huge difference coming from the M1 chip, but regardless, the iPad Air delivered smooth performance even
with various apps running simultaneously. You’ll likely notice a difference if you’re coming from an older A-series chip though.
As with its predecessor, it also packs slim bezels, a USB-C port, and Touch ID built into the top power button. The only
difference is that Apple finally moved the front-facing 12-megapixel camera to landscape orientation. —Brenda Stolyar
The iPad 10th-Gen () was never our top choice, mainly because it was too expensive for a basic iPad and the iPad ninth-gen was a
better value. But ever since Apple discontinued the ninth-generation version and reduced the price of this iPad by $100, the 10th
gen is for most people. It comes with a variety of notable upgrades, including slimmer bezels around a larger 10.9-inch Liquid
Retina (IPS LCD) display, a USB-C port instead of Lightning, a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button, a 12-megapixel
rear camera (up from 8 megapixels), and, most important, the 12-MP selfie camera has been moved to the center of the iPad—which
means you’ll no longer have to stare awkwardly to the side during video calls. It’s powered by Apple’s A14 Bionic chip, which is
also found in the iPhone 12, which delivers slightly faster performance and a bump in graphics over its predecessor. —Brenda
The iPad Mini () is my favorite tablet to travel with. The 8.3-inch display is great for a variety of activities including
watching movies, reading ebooks, sketching, and notetaking (it packs support for the second-generation Apple Pencil). With a
modern design, the iPad Mini also has Touch ID built into the power button, a USB-C charging port, and the front-facing camera is
equipped with Center Stage (which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame while on video calls). Under the hood is the same A15
Bionic processor that powers the iPhone 13 lineup, so it’ll easily handle taxing apps or games. It is, however, worth noting, that
this model came out in 2021. Apple is expected to announce the next-generation version in September or early next year. So, I
Apple's latest iPad Pro tablets () pack the largest notable upgrades we've seen in a long time. The larger version has a slightly
bigger and brighter display, at 13 inches, with an upgraded OLED screen (an improvement from mini-LED). The camera systems are a
bit different too. Rather than a dual-camera module on the back, you’ll get a single 12-megapixel wide camera, a lidar scanner,
and a new adaptive True Tone flash (which improves document scanning). Meanwhile, the front-facing camera has been moved to
landscape mode. This is also, so far, the only device powered by the all-new M4 chip. I didn’t notice a major difference in
performance compared to the M2 in its predecessor, but it felt smooth, snappy, and responsive, nonetheless. We originally
recommended holding off on this iPad Pro, in case Apple announced any groundbreaking features for iPadOS 18 at , but none of the
upcoming capabilities are exclusive to this chip. We still recommend the M2-powered iPad Pro over this one, because it’s overkill.
But if you want the latest and greatest, we highly suggest snagging it only when it’s on sale—as in, right now. —Brenda Stolyar
This used to be the most feature-packed Apple Pencil until the Apple Pencil Pro was announced a couple of months ago. As with the
first-gen version, it comes with pressure sensitivity, tilt sensitivity, and handwriting support. There’s a double-tap feature
too, which lets you switch quickly between tools by tapping on the Apple Pencil twice. You’ll also get wireless pairing and
wireless charging (the stylus automatically charges magnetically when attached to the top edge of supported iPads). It’s
compatible with the iPad Air (4th-Gen and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st-Gen and later) and the 12.9-inch (3rd-Gen and later), and
This is a great wireless charger if you own multiple Apple gadgets. It has a T-shaped design that suspends two of your devices
midair, including your iPhone (at the fastest 15-watt charging speed Apple allows), and it can fast-charge your Apple Watch
case). Belkin has since come out with a ($150) with Qi2 certification—the latest wireless charging standard, which you can learn
more about in . It’s fairly similar to this version, aside from a more rounded base and an iPhone charging pad that tilts to your
preferred angle (with the option to flip it into landscape mode to watch a video or trigger ). —Brenda Stolyar
The Symmetry Series+ Case holds the title of Best Overall in our . The mix of synthetic rubber and polycarbonate is durable, the
raised edges around the display are higher than many other basic cases, and the buttons are satisfying to press. It has a strong
MagSafe connection too. Overall, the case is protective without feeling clunky or adding too much weight. It looks stylish too,
specifically in the lime green color, but there are also plenty of other colors to pick from. This case is for the iPhone 13 and
iPhone 14, but it’s also available for the . —Brenda Stolyar
This wireless keyboard case from Zagg is thanks to its comfortable keyboard and detachable protective case if you want to keep
your iPad protected without having to carry the keyboard around with you, too. The touchpad isn’t quite as spacious as some other
models we’ve tested, but it’s still plenty to get basic work done. This case/keyboard combo comes in variations that fit most 10-
to 12-inch iPads, so make sure you get the right one that fits your device. —Eric Ravenscraft
I always carry two phones on me, one an iPhone and the other an Android. The Android is my work phone, and I don’t need a fancy
camera but I do prize a big battery and fast charging. I have the luxury of working with one of the journalism world’s top experts
on mobile phones, Julian Chokkattu, who had just the right phone to replace my busted Samsung Galaxy. The OnePlus 12R has been
great. The blazing-fast 100W charger, which comes included, does its business in a half hour and the phone will usually last me
two days on a single charge. The curved screen is pleasant and responsive, even if the photos don’t compare to my iPhone 15 Pro
I just reviewed the , but you can get a similar experience with last year’s model without spending $1,000. The exterior screen
isn’t as large as the latest Razr but it’s still roomy, allowing you to look at widgets, play some mini-games, and browse some
apps. Performance is great, it’s super compact when closed, and you can open it up to view a 6.9-inch OLED screen. What’s not to
like? Oh, and you can totally flip it closed to end a call. Nice. —Julian Chokkattu
This year’s Moto G Power 5G () is the best Moto G phone Motorola has made in a long time. It looks and feels luxe, and has all the
bells and whistles you could hope for in a modern-day phone, including wireless charging. The performance is solid, and the
cameras are capable. It’s a no-brainer at this price. The only problem? Motorola promises one OS upgrade and three years of
security updates, so don’t expect many new features after a year. —Julian Chokkattu
The Edge+ was my favorite , and it’s still a good buy at this price. You get an immersive 6.7-inch OLED display with curved edges,
a 165-Hz screen refresh rate, and the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen-2 chipset of 2023. It has it all, from NFC for tap-to-pay to
wireless charging. The only downside? The camera system is so-so, and this device will only get two more Android OS updates and
A Pixel 9 Fold is expected to arrive in August, which might explain this big price drop. The Pixel Fold () has the older Tensor G2
chipset, but this is still one of my favorite folding phones because it’s quite short and wide, unlike many other booklike folding
devices that opt for a tall and narrow experience. Wider apps are surprisingly nice as you can fit more on the 5.8-inch front
screen, but you can open this handset up and enjoy a full 7.6-inch screen for all your multitasking needs. Just remember that,
unlike newer Pixel phones, the Pixel Fold will only get four more years of security updates (and will only go up to Android 17).
This is one of our favorite cases for the Galaxy S24 series, and it’s available and . It comes in two parts: a hard outer shell
made from 35 percent recycled plastic that goes over a rubber inner cover. It has clicky buttons, good protection around the edges
of the screen, and the port is even covered up (it’s easy to flip open to plug in a USB-C charger). —Julian Chokkattu
I’ve been telling everyone with an Apple Watch that’s older than a Series 5 that they will need to upgrade soon. has a couple of
very exciting (for me) updates, but chief among them is that the OS is only compatible with watches released after the Series 6.
Happily, that includes the second-gen of the Watch SE so if you’re not planning on waiting for the latest, greatest upgrades at
Apple’s hardware event this fall, this is your best chance to pick one up that will have the new Vitals and Training Load apps.
The Ultra 2 () is our favorite Apple Watch for outdoor sports. You'll have access to onboard precision dual-frequency GPS, offline
maps (as long as you have them downloaded to your iPhone and keep it within Bluetooth range of the watch), and the ability to see
your cycling session as a Live Activity on your iPhone's screen. With the built-in Action button, you can also use the Backtrack
feature which creates virtual breadcrumb trails via the Compass app for when you're on your way back home. Under the hood is both
an S9 chip that delivers fast performance and an ultra-wideband chip for enhanced precision finding features (to help you locate
your iPhone when it's lost somewhere around the house). You'll also have access to Double Tap, which triggers functions like
hanging up a call or dismissing an alarm by tapping your index finger and thumb. —Brenda Stolyar
In a world awash with ever more technical fitness trackers collecting ever more esoteric data, I am grateful for the stripped down
simplicity and affordable price of a Fitbit. Late last year, we finally saw the company start to integrate more Google features
into its line of flagship . On the Charge 6 (), you can get directions via Google Maps, music controls with YouTube Music Premium,
and contactless pay with Google Wallet. The app redesign is lovely and no longer looks like it’s from 1996. And of course, you get
Fitbit’s full suite of health sensors and algorithmic expertise, although for the full benefit you do have to pay extra for a
Fitbit Premium subscription for more in-depth features. I have a caveat here that there’s no fall detection and sometimes
connectivity was an issue. Still, in a time where every fitness tracker seems to be adding on increasingly outlandish health
metrics, the Charge 6 is refreshingly simple, useful, and under $150. —Adrienne So
Did you want but you have an Android phone, or simply not enough room in the budget? Then the Sense 2 is for you. Like the Apple
Watch, it has skin temperature sensing, blood oxygen sensing, and an ECG sensor to note signs of atrial fibrillation. It also has
a stress response score, taking into account electrodermal activity and changes in your heart rate to tell you when you need to
take a chill pill and slow down (although I found the stress response test to be when I tested it). As always, you do need to have
a subscription to access some of the best health features, like sleep tracking. I also have to mention that if you really do want
an Apple Watch, the Apple Watch SE frequently dips on sale for below $200. However, buying an iPhone is a much higher barrier to
entry than a smaller monthly subscription, so if you wanted a more high-powered fitness tracker, this might be a good bet for you.
Bar none, the Pixel Watch is the and on the market right now. The first iteration was missing a lot of features, but the latest
one now has everything we wanted when it first came on the market, along with a faster processor and Wear 4, the latest version of
Google’s wearable OS. It pairs with Fitbit and that company’s lovely app redesign and it has all of Fitbit’s health features,
including a new feature called Body Response, which warns you when you’re stressed (like, you know, in the middle of Prime Day).
It’s so pretty that it almost makes you overlook the annoying proprietary charger and so-so battery life (you have to charge it
TCL’s QM8 series has been among the best mid-tier TVs you can buy for years now. When Parker Hall reviewed last year’s QM8 (), he
lauded the 75-inch model as a brighter and cheaper alternative to a projector. In my own review, I praised the TV for its mix of
fabulous brightness, rich colors, and the striking contrast of its mini LED, among plenty of great features. We haven’t yet
reviewed the 2024 version, the QM851G, as it’s relatively new. What we know so far is TCL has gone a little bonkers, claiming the
new screen provides double the peak brightness of last year’s model to create the brightest mini-LED TV on the market, besting
even the ultra-bright . The latest QM8 keeps all the other features we liked, including a mini-LED panel, a Google TV interface,
solid gaming features with HDMI 2.1 support, and much more. This TV stands to be one of the best mid-tier TVs you can buy this
year and an outstanding mercenary of brightness to battle even the most challenging lighting conditions. —Ryan Waniata
Roku’s first TV, the , was an impressive entry for the brand best known for making our favorite streaming software. With the Pro
Series, Roku proves it can hold its own against some of the best mid-tier TV brands (namely Hisense and TCL). The Pro Series has a
few flaws, including minor struggles with motion handling and, like virtually all LED TVs in its class, poor side-view
performance. On the bright side, its mini LED screen provides deep black levels, powerful brightness, and quantum dots for vibrant
colors. Unlike the Plus Series, it’s got a 120-Hz refresh rate and features like VRR for smooth gaming at high frame rates. As
well as it performs, the Pro Series’ biggest strength is usability, from its intuitive Roku OS smart interface to features like a
button on the side that produces a chime from its remote when you lose it. I just love using this TV, and when you pair that with
its standup picture performance, you get serious value—especially at its sale price of around $1,000. —Ryan Waniata
LG’s Gallery edition TVs have always been the cream of its OLED crop, but the G3 stands out as one of the best and brightest OLEDs
ever made, a major evolution from the previous year’s G2. Utilizing LG’s evo panel with technology enhancements like MLA
near-infinite contrast, a wide viewing angle, and brilliantly accurate yet vibrant colors. The stunning picture is just part of
the story, as the G3 provides a stylish panel designed to be flush mounted to your wall, four HDMI 2.1 inputs for 4K resolution at
LG’s lightning-fast A9 Gen-6 processor. While the newer G4 offers modest upgrades, this is a fabulous flagship display that’s
dropped to $1,000 below original price even before this sale. Not bad for one of the very best TVs you can buy. —Ryan Waniata
The trait I like best about the Roku Plus Series TV is right in the title—Roku’s simple and convenient operating system runs the
show. That makes this affordable QLED TV one of the best options for TV novices who just want a friendly and accommodating setup.
The TV has more up its sleeve, of course, including solid brightness contrasted by good black levels and vibrant quantum dot
colors. Its so-so motion handling and 60-Hz panel (rather than the 120-Hz panel of some rivals) means it's not the best for sports
or gaming, but it throws in usability features like available hands-free search and a remote finder that assures you’ll never
again lose the little bugger in your couch cushions. The Plus Series’ blend of solid features, performance, and design mixed with
Roku’s oh-so-easy interface make for a welcome entry into the flashy world of 4K HDR—especially at this price. —Ryan Waniata
Samsung’s Frame TV has won the hearts of buyers for years now thanks to its distinctive aesthetic, which frames the TV panel like
a painting to blend in with your decor. The latest model offers a matte, anti-glare screen like the new Samsung S95D (), which
provides a slick aesthetic that looks more like the canvas of a painting than a traditional glossy screen. The anti-glare tech
also dissipates in-room reflections more than regular screens. Behind the Frame’s matte screen is a 4K HDR QLED display, which
uses quantum dots for bright and vivid colors. Add in features like a customizable picture border, background art displays at
rest, and a sensor to turn the TV on or off when you enter or leave a room and you’ve got a work of art that’s also a solid 4K TV.
After a decade away, Samsung jumped back into OLED TVs to near-universal praise with its S95 series. The second-edition S95C ()
brings a potent mix of quantum dot colors, improved brightness, and all the best OLED traits like perfect black levels and a wide
viewing angle. It all adds up to a picture that’s among the most stunning you can buy. Like all Samsung TVs, the S95C lacks Dolby
Vision support and uses Samsung’s cluttered Tizen interface, but it heaps in plenty of other topline features. You’ll get a fully
loaded inputs section, a fabulous gaming hub, and support for gaming extras like VRR for silky motion. Samsung’s latest S95D ()
has higher brightness, but its new anti-reflective screen has pros and cons depending on your room. Especially given its sinking
price, 2023’s S95C is one of the you can buy right now, full stop. —Ryan Waniata
I’ve only spent a few days with the U7N so far, but this follow up to last year’s excellent U7K has already impressed. Its mini
LED panel provides flashy brightness balanced by excellent contrast and black levels, helping the TV exceed expectations for its
price class. It adds expansive quantum dot colors, solid gaming features alongside a high-refresh 120-Hz panel, and plenty of
other extras you wouldn’t expect to land for well under $1,000. That is, you wouldn’t expect it from brands other than Hisense,
and a few of its mid-tier competitors like TCL and Roku. This is simply a solid value, now at its lowest price of the year so far.
The Roku Streaming Stick 4K is the for most people. There are fancier devices with more features, but are generally the simplest
to set up and navigate. A no-frills home screen shows you all your apps without extra clutter so you can do what you came there to
This particular Roku bundle is an Amazon exclusive. Unlike the Streaming Stick 4K, the Express 4K doesn’t support Dolby Vision or

Remote Pro lets you ask Roku to do things, like pull up Netflix, without having to actually touch a button. That also means that
if you lose it in the couch cushions, you just have to ask Roku where it is for it to play a sound. This has come in handy more
If you have a smaller room but are looking for immersive audio to pair with your fancy late-generation TV, this is a very solid
choice () that ranks among . It has clean looks, dedicated rear speakers, and a subwoofer, and the ability to fire sound off your
ceiling for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X effects like helicopters flying above you in action movies. We see deals on this model all the
time, but $400 is about as low as it ever goes, which makes now a good time to buy. —Parker Hall
Vizio’s Elevate () is designed to bring a bit of visual excitement to an otherwise boring product category, using a pair of
turning drivers on the outside of the bar to aim sound either at your ears or the ceiling, depending on what you’re watching. Play
music or other non-Dolby Atmos audio and the two side drivers on the bar aim at your ears, but they turn skyward when you play any
content with immersive audio, creating a height channel. It also comes with wireless surround speakers and a subwoofer, for a more
When I started testing Bose’s pint-sized , I was instantly impressed by the sheer musicality and immersion it creates from such a
small frame. Bose’s blend of advanced signal processing and well-placed acoustics, including dedicated upfiring drivers, creates
engaging sound for everything from Dolby Atmos movies to sitcoms or your favorite Spotify Playlist. The one missing element is
lower bass, which can take some of the punch out of action flicks, but Bose does sell an should you want to supplement the
soundbar later. As with Sonos’s Beam, the 600 offers streaming over Wi-Fi, a built-in microphone for Amazon Alexa voice commands,
and the ability to connect with other Bose speakers in a multiroom audio setup. Unlike the Beam, it also includes Bluetooth as a
backup to Wi-Fi streaming and a dedicated remote. It all adds up to a loaded smart bar that sounds a lot better than you’d expect.
If you want proper home theater bass, you’re gonna want a subwoofer. I like this 2.1 bar from Polk () for smaller living rooms
where you still want cinematic low end. It isn’t as immersive as the more expensive Sony bar above, but it still scratches the
Dolby Atmos itch too, bouncing sound off the walls to surround you as best it can. —Parker Hall
All-in-one soundbars tend to barely be better than the crappy built-in speakers on your flatscreen, which is why with this bar
from Sony. Not only does it feature built-in drivers that are dedicated to low end (they call it a built-in subwoofer), but this
model can shoot sound off your walls and ceiling to simulate Dolby Atmos object-based audio. Sony’s audio and video processing is
legendary and leads to this smallish bar sounding massive, especially in medium-to-small rooms like apartment living rooms or
Depending on your desk setup a soundbar underneath your monitor might be a better fit than speakers and this one won a place in

The Beats Solo 4 (), an update of 2016’s Solo 3, were a long time coming. For all the waiting, Beats kept the features quite
minimal, without adding upgrades like noise canceling and transparency mode. The Solo 4 headphones aren’t bereft of modern extras,
though, with features like one-touch pairing and Find My support for both iPhone and Android devices, as well as spatial audio
support and Hands-Free Siri support for iPhone. The Solo 4’s sound is what really impressed me, with clear detail and a buttery
touch to the bass and lower midrange that combines for a fun and vibrant performance. For Beats fans after a deal who don’t mind
sacrificing noise canceling, the Solo 4 could be worth grabbing above cheaper offerings, especially at a price that falls well
When I reviewed the Studio Pros (), I called them good not great, which is true at their full $350 price. At $250 or lower, the
Studio Pros rise above that status, especially if you like their style and sound, which are equally vibrant, colorful, and fun.
Their zippy treble and firm but balanced bass help them stand out in a crowded market. They skip extras like auto-pause sensors,
something the majority of headphones in their class offer, but they also bring some Apple exclusives like support for “Hey Siri”
and Find My support. They pair those with Android extras like Google Fast Pair and Find My Device, playing both sides of the
aisle. I was also impressed by the Studio Pros’ natural-sounding transparency mode, which pairs with their solid noise canceling
for a pretty clutch package. Greatness is subjective, but at this price, I’d say the Studio Pros easily qualify. –Ryan Waniata
Sony’s Linkbuds S are an odd follow-up to the original Linkbuds () in that, besides the fact that they’re both small Sony earbuds,
they share very little in common. Unlike the original Linkbuds, the “S” model has no hole through the middle to let in the outside
world. Instead, they’re designed like traditional wireless earbuds, offering features like noise canceling and transparency mode
to block out or let in the world around you, respectively. Their biggest asset is their small size, which makes them brilliantly
light and comfy. They also bring lots of customization options like a multi-band EQ, speak-to-chat (which pauses the buds when you
talk), and Adaptive Sound Control to adjust to your environment. They top things off with clear and zippy sound, though it does
lean toward the brighter side. The Linkbuds S were too pricey at $200, but at $130 or so they’re a good deal for Sony buds with a
These Sennheisers are our . Wired in-ear headphones are a great way to take top-tier audio quality with you anywhere for use with
any device (provided it has a headphone jack). The Sennheisers are ergonomic and wrap comfortably around your ear for a secure fit
and a good seal. The quality dynamic drivers mean you'll hear all of your music and virtually none of the world around you. If you
want wired headphone audio quality but want something compact you can travel with, these are a great option, especially at this
Sennheiser’s Momentum 4 headphones aren’t the best noise cancelers and they don’t offer the most features. What they do offer is,
perhaps unsurprising to the Sennheiser faithful, the best sound of anything I’ve tested in their class. You’ll get clear,
unwavering definition and instrumental placement spread across a rich and engaging soundstage. Everything sounds better with the
Momentum 4, and you’ll likely discover new details about songs you’ve heard dozens of times. They don’t stop there, offering
respectable noise canceling, handy features like multipoint pairing to connect to two devices at once, and knockout battery life
of up to 60 hours per charge. You can futz with the settings in the Sennheiser app, including messing with the EQ (not that you’ll
need to). If you’re after great travel headphones that sound a notch above the rest, the Momentum 4 are the pair to grab. —Ryan
Denon’s PerL earbuds () have a neat trick that maps your hearing like an ear doctor and adjusts the sound accordingly. There are
lots of earbuds that offer some version of this, but Denon’s comes from a company called that has been evolving its customization
technique for years. The result is impressively clear and detailed sound tailored just for you, though you may have to do a few
rounds of tests before you get it dialed in just right. The earbuds are bulky and can wear on your ears after a few hours, but the
fit is stable and features like noise canceling, a volume limiter, and adjustable auto-pause make them worth considering,
These noise-canceling earbuds from lesser-known brand Raycon () surprised me with their quality build and great features. They
rival much more expensive buds on sound, and I liked them enough to give them an excellent review at full price. At the $50 mark,
as long as you're in need of a pair of great cheap buds, these are a no-brainer. —Parker Hall
If you want to pick just how much of the outside world pipes through to you during your running or cycling playlist for safety

JLab’s Go Air Pop buds are an exercise in sheer technological concision. There’s nothing fancy or superfluous here, just solid
earbuds that work well for less money than you might spend on a Tuesday night happy hour. You’ll get up to eight hours of battery
per charge, simple touch controls, a charging case with multiple recharges, and even a few EQ presets to adjust the sound. The
audio performance is understandably basic, but it’s easygoing and unobjectionable for music and podcasts. Add in fun colors and
moderate water resistance and you’ve got a guilt-free purchase that’s perfect for those who just want some cheap wireless earbuds
that get the job done. These are already at their regular $25 price, and their latest discount makes them even harder to pass up.
Whether you are jogging, cycling, working out, or running errands, headphones that stay in place and can withstand some sweat are
a necessity. These open-ear headphones can clip onto a titanium memory wire to fit securely around the back of your neck. They can
go for 14 hours with an additional 40 or so from the charging case. WIRED editor Adrienne So said they are the comfiest she has
tested, and they appear in our guide. They have been on sale before, but this is the first time we have seen a discount this deep.
The feature-packed Liberty 4 NC wireless earbuds () boast excellent noise canceling for the money. Reviewer Ryan Waniata said they
combine clear and relatively detailed sound with flashy looks. He also found them light and comfortable to wear with plenty of

With solid hybrid active noise-canceling, excellent 40-hour playtime, and pretty good sound quality for the money, there are our
favorite noise-canceling . They have 40-mm silk diaphragm drivers inside and work well as a travel companion. Just be careful of
the fragile plastic headband. While these headphones are frequently discounted to this price, we have never seen them cheaper.
If you think most earbuds just aren’t small enough, then you need the JLab Audio JBuds Mini. They’re our pick for folks with
smaller ears, but we’ve also . The earbuds are barely the size of a pinkie fingertip, and the case that holds them is only a
little bigger than a quarter (and half the size of an AirPods Pro case!) Not only are these headphones cute and tiny, but they
also come in a handful of fun colors that are all on sale for 30 percent off. —Nena Farrell
If you’re looking for a more comfortable version of AirPods but refuse to settle for a non-Apple product, the Beats Fit Pro () are
some of the best earbuds around. They have the same noise-canceling (and largely the same sensors and processing) as Apple’s buds,
but they’re much more comfortable. In my opinion, these are cheaper and better than AirPods Pro. —Parker Hall
Sony’s little can-shaped speaker sounds way better than it has a right to for its size, especially if you give it a solid base on
which to pump its tunes. When sitting properly on a good table or countertop, the XB100 () blasts clear and pleasant audio with
impressive bass for a speaker you can easily fit in a purse, pack, or coat pocket. It’s also pretty loaded on the feature side,
with up to 16 hours of battery, Google Fast Pair, and easy access controls. It comes in a variety of fun colors, perfect for
summer, and its dust- and water-resistance rating means it can hang at a sandy beach or even survive a quick dunk in the pool.
This speaker has become my go-to option when traveling light, livening up my hotel or Airbnb with solid sound. I loved it at full
price. On a good sale, it’s a no-brainer. —Ryan Waniata
This isn’t the latest or greatest Ultimate Ears speaker, but it still is a well-designed option that is waterproof, has excellent
bass, and has speakers on both sides for 360-degree sound (). Twenty hours of battery life and big volume and pairing buttons make
this easy to use, and it even floats if you toss it in the water at the beach. —Parker Hall
This speaker only gets an honorable mention in our guide because it carries a high price tag. This Prime Day mitigates that issue
with a hefty discount. The second generation of the Soundlink Revolve+ has some of the best room (or yard)-filling sound I’ve
tested in any speaker, thanks to its lanternlike shape. Speakers all around shoot sound in 360 degrees, which makes this a great
thing to set on a table next to the hors d'oeuvres. —Parker Hall
This follow-up from the popular Motion Boom speaker provides big and punchy sound, an easy grip handle for portability, and
dunkable water resistance–it even floats so you can take it on all your watersport adventures. The customizable LEDs on the Boom

powerplant of 80 watts of amplification and three separate speakers, including a 50-watt racetrack woofer, make for a powerful
JBL’s Authentics 200 smart speaker () is fluent in both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, allowing you to use either assistant or
both concurrently to do a variety of tasks. This makes it perfect for those with multiple smart products around the house. Its
retro design stands out for its tactile knobs and foam grille, but its excellent sound quality is our favorite trait. After
testing the 200 against competitors for several days, we were pleased to find it wedged between the fantastic Sonos Era 100 and
the powerful Era 300, two of the best-sounding smart speakers on the market. That makes this JBL model something of a ringer, and
a great value on sale for those after a stylish and versatile smart speaker that sounds as good as it looks. —Ryan Waniata
JBL’s popular Go speaker is a truly travel-ready sonic companion. It’s got the durability you need, including IP67 dust and water
resistance that lets you hit the turf or surf anxiety free. The palm-sized speaker isn’t exactly a bass-bomber, but it provides
clear and relatively full sound with solid definition in a fun package that comes in a wide range of colors (though be careful as
not all of them are priced the same). We’ve seen the speaker sell as high as $50 recently, which is a stretch considering its
mediocre 5-hour battery life, but at around $30 this rugged rocker provides good value. —Ryan Waniata
Anything we review here at WIRED rarely gets a perfect 10/10, but the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless . HyperX claimed this headset
gets up to 300 hours of battery life, which is about 10 times more than most competing headsets can achieve. I put that claim to
the test … and it exceeded 325 hours. It’s not often we come across a company that claims to beat the competition by 10 times,
much less one that goes even further. The ear cups are comfy, the audio quality is great, and the mic is solid for team chat, but
that battery life is the star of this show. —Eric Ravenscraft
If there's a bell and/or whistle you could ask for in a gaming headset, the Arctis Nova Pro likely has it. The headset comes with

to mix sidetone, team chat, and game audio so you can hear exactly what you need to hear at any given moment. The GameDAC supports
two USB-C inputs, so you can play on multiple consoles without having to swap cables. I loved the wireless version of this headset
The Corsair K100 is a unique keyboard, thanks mainly to its customizable wheel on the upper left side. This is a feature most
keyboards don’t have, but it’s incredibly handy for things like scrubbing through media or controlling the timeline in video
editing applications. If you’re a media professional, there are several presets for Adobe apps like Premiere, After Effects, and
Photoshop. I’m a big fan of , and the K100 has some unique options for doing so that I can’t find anywhere else. It doesn’t hurt
This is one of our —a new guide we launched to focus specifically on mechanical boards by WIRED contributor Henri Robbins, who is
deeply ingrained in this space. Seriously, he pulls apart keyboards just to see how the manufacturer assembled them with each
review. You might be surprised then to see that he liked the BlackWidow V4 () board from a big-name brand like Razer. That's
because this is the company's first real foray into the world of custom mechanical keyboards, and aside from the fact that opening

If there’s another microphone as recognizable as a Blue Yeti, it’s probably the HyperX Quadcast S (). Twitch streamers in
particular gravitate to this mic because, in addition to picking up excellent audio over USB without needing complicated extra
hardware, it comes with RGB LEDs built-in. The LEDs sit under a mesh of circular cutouts, giving the mic an iconic look that
catches the eye on camera. It also has convenient features like a large, tappable mute button and a gain knob built into the
bottom of the mic, all of which make it easy to control your audio while you’re managing your stream. —Eric Ravenscraft
Nothing says “for gamers” like slapping a bunch of RGB LEDs on something, which means this mesh Wi-Fi system from Asus is
screaming it. This system is easy to set up and supports Wi-Fi 6 and , including blistering fast speeds over both 2.4-GHz and
competitive games. But all of that is secondary to the most important feature: that grid of LEDs on the front in the shape of the
Rog logo. It glows red by default, but you can tweak it to any color you want. That makes your games better, right? —Eric
Curved, ultrawide monitors provide an incredibly immersive experience, and this QD-OLED display from Alienware () does an amazing
job at it. It has the characteristic infinite blacks of most other OLED displays, but with better color accuracy and less wasted
energy. The 34-inch screen is pretty large, but the 3,440 x 1,400 resolution means that text is still super crisp and readable
from a typical sitting distance, and the HDR Peak 1000 mode emits so much light (aptly, 1,000 nits) that reviewer Simon Hill said
he had to squint while playing on it at night. —Eric Ravenscraft
In our guide to , we recommend this 1,000-watt power supply as a good option for desktop computers that have multiple graphics
cards or an excess of storage. It’s quiet, fast, and efficient. The modular design isn’t particularly unique when it comes to
power supplies—most PSUs around this price point are fully modular— but it’s still a nice feature to have. —Louryn Strampe
When you’re , the motherboard is one of the most crucial elements. The motherboard is the “base” of your desktop—everything else
plugs into it. We recommend the Gigabyte B650 if you’re building a mid- to high-end PC using an AMD processor. It’s got plenty of
dedicated slots for memory and storage, an easy-to-use BIOS, and a pretty straightforward layout. There are nice extras, too, like
support for addressable LED and a few built-in Thunderbolt ports. If you’ve built a computer before, you might not even need to
consult the manual when putting everything together (though, when in doubt, you always should). —Louryn Strampe
A processor is one of the most important components when it comes to . We recommend this as a great AMD option for gaming or
editing rigs. It isn’t the fastest or most powerful of the bunch, but it should still be more than enough for most use
cases—especially if you’re not trying to spend a whole lot of money. It’ll be able to handle modern games and video editing, and
it’ll do it for much less than higher-end alternatives. —Louryn Strampe
Sixty percent keyboards are among the smallest you can get, and the Razer Huntsman Mini is . It drops the numpad, arrow keys,
function keys, and basically anything else it can get away with cutting. The Huntsman Mini is still just as responsive and
satisfying as keyboards twice its size, but it leaves you a lot more extra space on your desk. The small, white frame is stylish
and looks great in a tidy workspace. It’s also small enough to toss in a bag if you want to take it with you, though personally I

Belkin’s BoostCharge Power Bank sits in the honorable mentions section of our , but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve
tracked. It has a 5,000-mAh capacity, so don’t expect it to fully recharge an iPhone from zero to 100 percent. But it comes in
some nice colors, and there’s a kickstand (though it works best in landscape orientation). The magnets feel a bit weak in this
As one of the biggest names in , Anker’s expansion into seemed like a natural fit. The Solix series combines attractive design

Built-in handles make it relatively easy to carry. It can charge up all your small gadgets or power devices, such as a small
fridge, TV, or power drill. There is an XT60 input to charge from solar panels. We have seen the C1000 drop to $600 before but
this is a new low. Anker also has some bundle deals combining power stations and solar panels on sale, such as the larger . —Simon
We love this handy little jump starter so much, . It’s a portable battery pack that can jump-start most cars. It doesn’t take up
too much space in the trunk or your backseat, but it can be a real lifesaver if you end up needing it—like WIRED reviewer Eric
Ravenscraft did when he discovered that his alternator was going bad while out of state. This pack has a built-in flashlight, and
it can charge your phone in a pinch as well. Better safe than sorry! —Louryn Strampe
This versatile, expandable, dependable device tops our . The Explorer 2000 Plus offers a decent mix of ports with support for
fast-charging your gadgets and boasts a handy 2,042-watt-hour capacity. You can expand it with modular battery packs, use it as an
emergency power supply (EPS), and charge it multiple ways, including from a wall outlet or solar panels. It is bulky and heavy,
but there’s a telescopic handle and wheels to make it easier to lug around. It worked very well in my tests, powering various
devices with ease, and it is relatively quiet in operation. The LiFePO4 battery should be good for 10 years, and Jackery offers a

This isn't technically a Prime Day deal, but it's still a great price on . I've used both the two-person and four-person models of
the Copper Spur over the years, and Big Agnes has continually refined the design to the point that I have nothing left to complain
about. This is a high-quality, well-designed tent. It's lightweight, easy to set up, and stable even in strong winds. The Copper

I own the slightly older version of this Deuter day pack, and the suspension system is so comfortable that I regularly load it
down with way more than the recommended weight and have yet to have a problem. I found the same to be true of this updated version

Sea to Summit's Alto TR1 is . The two-person Telos is a very similar, roomier tent. These are Sea to Summit’s first tents, and the
company really nailed it with a roomy design, minimal fuss setup, and some nice extras like separate tent and fly stuff sacks
which allow for just taking just the fly, or easily sharing weight with a backpacking partner. —Scott Gilbertson
This is not technically a Prime Day deal, but it is a good one. We love the Hero 12; it’s . It’s the camera I reach for when I
head out the door. It’s got good battery life and excellent stabilization, and it overheats far less than previous models. The
only downside is it dropped GPS support. If you want that you can add a separate GPS accessory or go for the GoPro 11 below.
You’ll also get a free one-year subscription to GoPro Premium. That’s GoPro’s subscription service, which gives unlimited cloud
storage, damaged camera replacement, and discounts on accessories (it’ll renew at $50/year). —Scott Gilbertson
Once , the A7III remains a solid choice, especially on sale for under $1,300. The 24-megapixel sensor can capture 15 stops of
dynamic range in 14-bit uncompressed RAW files and the autofocus, while not as good as the A7IV or A7V, is still solid. It can
shoot excellent 4K video as well, and is still a popular choice with YouTubers. I wouldn’t hesitate to invest at this price; it’ll
save you some money that you can dedicate to lenses. —Scott Gilbertson
Want a tote bag to carry around your camera equipment? This one from Moment can be carried as a tote, or you can use the longer
strap to wear it like a messenger bag. I’ve taken this to the beach plenty of times, with my camera equipment safe in the center
padded area (which is removable, making the bag more versatile). There are a few organization options inside and small pockets on
the exterior of two sides. Snag it in yellow! It’s a vibe. —Julian Chokkattu
Insta360's X3 () has been superseded by the X4 (, but not on sale), but it's still a great 360 and action camera combo. The sensor
is capable of 5.7K 360 video (that yields 1,080p video when cropping to flat formats like online video) and shoots 4K video in
single lens mode. The battery life is good and it's dead simple to use with voice commands and a large, bright screen.

These are the larger siblings of the TrailSeeker 8x32 binoculars, which we love (). The difference is the size of the front lens
in millimeters. This pair, with its 42-mm lenses, will allow more light to reach your eye, which translates to a bigger, brighter,
and clearer image (all other factors being the same, which in this case they are). I have never used this particular model, but
given how much I like the 8x32, I have no problem recommending these. —Scott Gilbertson

A second person will soon receive ’s experimental brain implant, according to Elon Musk, the company’s cofounder.
In , Musk said the surgery is planned to take place in “the next week or so.” The company is making changes to the surgical
procedure and placement of the device to avoid problems that arose with its first participant, whose implant partially detached
from the brain a few weeks after surgery.
Neuralink is developing a brain-computer interface, or BCI, which uses a person’s brain signals to control an external device. Its

For now, the company is running an early feasibility study to evaluate the safety and functionality of its device in people with
paralysis. As part of the study, in January. Arbaugh is paralyzed from the shoulders down due to a swimming accident that occurred
in 2016.
Neuralink’s coin-sized implant sits in the skull and has 64 flexible wire threads thinner than a human hair that extend into the
brain tissue. Each thread contains 16 electrodes that collect intended movement signals from neurons.
At first, the device was functioning as it should. , allowing him to play video games, email friends, and browse the Internet. But
a few weeks after the surgery, the implant started to malfunction and Arbaugh lost control of the cursor.
In a on its website, Neuralink said a number of threads had retracted from Arbaugh’s brain, resulting in a net decrease in the
number of effective electrodes. In response, Neuralink modified its neural recording algorithm to be more sensitive and improved
how it translates neural signals into cursor movements.
Arbaugh is back to using a computer with his brain, although just 15 percent of the implant’s threads are still working, according
to Neuralink executives. In an , Arbaugh said the device has given him back a sense of independence.
Still, Neuralink is trying to avoid the same issues with its second study participant. “We really want to make sure that we make
as much progress as possible between each Neuralink patient,” Musk said Wednesday.
During the video update, company executives acknowledged that air was trapped inside Arbaugh’s skull after surgery, which could
have contributed to the threads coming out. Matthew MacDougall, Neuralink’s head of neurosurgery, said the company is taking steps
to eliminate this air pocket in its second volunteer. It also plans to insert the threads deeper into the brain tissue and track
the movement of those threads.
so we're going to broaden the range of depths at which we insert threads,” MacDougall said.
In addition, the company’s surgeons plan to “sculpt the surface of the skull” to minimize the gap under the implant so that it
sits flush with the normal contour of the skull. This, MacDougall said, should “minimize the gap under the implant” and “put it
closer to the brain and eliminate some of the tension on the threads.”
Musk said he hopes to implant Neuralink’s device in the “high single digits” of study participants this year. (A says the company
He added that Neuralink is working on a next-generation implant that has 128 threads, each with eight electrodes per thread, a
change that he says will “potentially double the bandwidth if we are accurate with the placement of the threads.” Musk didn’t
provide a timeline on when that device will be ready to test in people.

This affordable Wi-Fi 6 router currently tops our even when it’s not discounted for Prime Day because it combines a slick design
with reliable performance. It’s a dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) router capable of speedy connections and suitable for an
average-sized home with an internet connection of 1 Gbps or less. There are four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN
port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. It’s easy to set up and configure through TP-Link’s Tether app, and you get basic security
and features like QoS (Quality of Service) included. Unfortunately, if you want more in-depth security or parental controls, you
must subscribe to Security+ at $5 a month or $36 a year and Advanced Parental Controls at $3 a month or $18 a year. This router
has been floating around this price for the last few months, but it is still a good deal. —Simon Hill
For folks with large homes, Netgear’s Orbi offer some of the widest coverage available. This tri-band, Wi-Fi 6 mesh boasts two

or thereabouts in my tests on the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, with an extra 5-GHz band left over for backhaul (traffic between the
main router and the node). Asus mesh systems stand out from the crowd because they come with security software and parental
controls free for the lifetime of the devices (no subscription required). You can also set up a guest network, prioritize traffic
for specific activities, such as video calls, and dig into the weeds on settings, though folks who prefer to remain hands-off may
As the budget pick in our guide, this system from TP-Link is already affordable, but the Prime Day discount makes it even more of
a bargain. This Wi-Fi 6 dual-band system (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) proved easy to set up and was very dependable in my tests. It’s not
the fastest mesh, but folks with internet connection speeds of 500 Mbps or below should be satisfied. Each router has two gigabit
Ethernet ports, and they blend in easily on shelves or tables. This mesh came with free software when it was first released, but
if you want anything beyond basic security and parental controls now, you will, unfortunately, need a subscription (Security+
costs $5 a month or $36 a year, and Advanced Parental Controls costs $3 a month or $18 a year). Even with the subscriptions, the
X20 is an affordable way to ensure reliable Wi-Fi throughout your home. —Simon Hill
We all expect strong Wi-Fi inside our homes, but what about the backyard? If you’re lazing in the sun, you might want to read on

extends your Wi-Fi up to 2,500 square feet, enough to cover most backyards and then some. It can connect to any Deco mesh, or you
can run an Ethernet cable since it supports Power-over-Ethernet (PoE). We have seen discounts on this before, but this is the

costing $3 a month or $18 a year. —Simon Hill
Although it only made the honorable mentions section of our , this is an excellent Wi-Fi 6E mesh, only missing out on a full
recommendation because of its relatively high release price. With the discount, you should consider this tri-band mesh system
because it is one of the fastest Wi-Fi 6E mesh routers I have tested. The range on the 6-GHz band was relatively wide compared
with cheaper systems like the XE75, and the XE200 finished near the top of the table in most speed tests. You will need
subscriptions for more than basic security and parental controls. Security+ is $5 a month or $36 a year, and Advanced Parental

Believe it or not, some things still use batteries. If your household churns through them, this is a cheap way to invest in some
rechargeables for your clocks, toys, emergency kits, computer mice, or remotes. They’ll arrive precharged and can be recharged up
to 1,000 times each. It’s pretty hard to get a battery wrong—these are totally fine, and the price is right for Prime Day. If you
don’t already have a charger around, . My house also has the unfortunately named to keep ours sorted. —Louryn Strampe
This is a slight variation of . While that Plugable dock only supports two monitors, this one not only bumps that up to three, but
each monitor has the option of connecting via either HDMI or DisplayPort, for maximum flexibility. There have been more than a few
times that the DisplayPort cable I have is just a few inches too short, and it would’ve been much easier to swap to a longer HDMI
cable rather than be stuck with only the one option. Normally, this one would be a bit too pricey compared with our top
triple-monitor docking station, but this Prime Day discount brings it down to a reasonable price. —Eric Ravenscraft
Want a tote bag to carry around your camera equipment? This one from Moment can be carried as a tote, or you can use the longer
strap to wear it like a messenger bag. I’ve taken this to the beach plenty of times, with my camera equipment safe in the center
padded area (which is removable, making the bag more versatile). There are a few organization options inside and small pockets on
the exterior of two sides. Snag it in yellow! It’s a vibe. —Julian Chokkattu
I’m working on a portable monitors guide right now, but the Arzopa is going to be my top pick. It has a sharp 144-Hz 16-inch
screen with a Full HD resolution, and a built-in kickstand to keep it upright. You can plug it in via the included USB-C cables to
your device to extend your screen anywhere, and it’s fairly slim, so it’ll fit in most backpack laptop sleeves just fine. —Julian
Google’s Pixel Tablet and Charging Stand () does a great job of marrying tablet and a smart display into one. The future of smart
displays is using the screens you already have, after all, and this handy combo gives you a full-fledged Android tablet that turns
into a solid smart display when you aren’t using it. It does a good job being both things, too, which can be rare for combination
devices, and the dock speakers are robust and loud enough to fill a room with music. And as someone who often forgets to charge
her tablet, having a dedicated space to easily charge it between uses (and never wonder where I left it, either!) is crazy
Sonos-enabled turntables might seem stupid to audio purists but they're actually quite handy when it comes to playing your
favorite records around the house. That's why we're fans of this medium-end model from Victrola (). It’s a decent enough
standalone deck, but the Sonos connectivity is what makes it worth a little more than similar models, even on Prime Day. —Parker
This tiny little PNY flash drive is our top pick for compact portable storage in our guide. With support for USB 3.2 Gen 2 (), it
can handle large files with blisteringly fast speeds. PNY claims that read speeds up to 600MB/s and write speeds up to 250MB/s,
but in my own testing, it gets far beyond that. In fact, it’s so fast that I use it when testing , and routinely get both read and
write speeds in excess of 800MB/s. Your mileage may vary, depending on the connectors on your laptop or any adapters you use, but
if it’s fast enough to use as a baseline for my testing the transfer of massive media files, there’s a good chance it’s plenty
fast for anything you can throw at it. —Eric Ravenscraft
Did you know iPhones can for your MacBook? It’s a relatively new feature called Continuity Camera and a very seamless process to
get it all going. But where do you put your iPhone while webcamming? Enter this Belkin mount. It magnetically sticks to the back
of the and a little lip sticks out where you can hang it over your MacBook screen. When you’re not teleconferencing, you can use
the mount as a kickstand or phone grip. —Julian Chokkattu
Digital photo frames are great, as are curated social media feeds of your favorite photos, but I love having . Canon’s Selphy QX10
prints 2.7-by-2.7-inch Polaroid-like images with adhesive backs. The comes with an ink pack, so you’ll always have enough. I also
tested Canon’s larger printer, the , which prints on 4-by-6-inch paper. These are two products I was genuinely sad to give back
after testing, and I have on my own list for Prime Day buys. If you’re as nostalgic as me, one of these is worth the purchase,
It is way too early for most folks to worry about Wi-Fi 7, but if you’re an early adopter with deep pockets looking to
future-proof, TP-Link’s enormous Deco BE85 mesh system is worth a look. The TP-Link Deco BE85 () is a seriously fast tri-band
router that takes full advantage of the newly opened 6-GHz band to offer some of the fastest speeds I’ve seen. These large, white,
vaselike routers boast two 10 Gbps and two 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports apiece. For more than basic security and parental controls, you
do need subscriptions, and this is a pricey system, even with the discount, but it’s also . —Simon Hill
Simplicity is attractive for many folks, and when it comes to Wi-Fi we all just want a stable, speedy connection that works. The
Google Nest Wifi Pro () is one of the easiest and I have ever tested. It may lack some bells and whistles, but if you prefer to
remain hands-off with your tech, this is the mesh system for you. This tri-band system opens up the 6-GHz band, but it is mostly
reserved for backhaul (sending traffic between the main router and nodes). The cute design blends in easily, the Nest Wifi Pro
offers decent performance, is very easy to set up in the Google Home app, and includes smart home extras like Matter and Thread
With an understated design, Google’s Nest Cam is a wired indoor security camera that records clear 1080p video thanks to HDR and a
relatively high frame rate (30 fps). It also supports two-way audio, night vision kicks on automatically when the lights go out,
and notifications come through swiftly and reliably. The catch is you need a Nest Aware subscription at $8 per month ($80/year) to
get 30 days of event video history and smart features, like familiar face alerts. On the plus side, that subscription covers all
of your Nest devices. If you can stomach the cost, this is my . Face recognition is very handy, as notifications tell me when the
kids or my wife come home and instantly flag strangers. —Simon Hill
The Google Nest Cam is our recommendation for if Google runs your house, and the Google Nest Cam with Floodlight is perfect to add
to areas where you want a floodlight to boost your security. There are three hours of free event history, or you can add on the
Nest Aware subscription ($8 a month, or $80 for the whole year) to get 30 days of event history and have the camera identify faces
it sees. It captures sharp 1080p video with HDR and night vision, has a clear speaker and microphone, and the motion detection is
Security cameras with floodlights attached are a great way to secure areas like your garage or backyard. Motion will trigger the
light and a video recording, and the camera can record color footage because the area is illuminated. The E340 is a dual-lens
camera with a 3K wide angle lens and a 2K telephoto lens for up to 8x zoom to capture details up to 50 feet away. Two adjustable
light panels can put out up to 2,000 lumens. It can also pan 360 degrees and tilt 120 degrees, record locally to a microSD card up
to 128 GB, or connect to a HomeBase 3 (both sold separately). This is one of the and an excellent choice for folks seeking a
This versatile device is the pan-and-tilt pick in our guide. It’s ideal if you want a hands-off camera you can set up and leave to
do its thing. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that
boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3X zoom in the center of the
frame (it goes up to 8x hybrid zoom). There’s also 8 GB of storage built in to keep things local. The relatively low 15 fps frame
rate is disappointing, and the two-way audio quality is not great, but there is onboard AI and subject tracking. —Simon Hill
This two-pack of comes with an indoor hub for local video recording. The camera can record up to 2K resolution and supports color
night vision. The small hub plugs into your router via an and takes microSD cards up to 256 GB (sold separately), so there’s no
need for a cloud storage subscription. The Tapo app offers privacy zones, sensitivity sliders, scheduling, privacy mode, and smart
detection for people, pets, and vehicles. The two-way audio is not the best, and I got some false positives, but these security
cameras are generally reliable and a solid pick for folks who prefer to keep everything local. —Simon Hill
This relatively affordable camera can record video at up to 2K and 30 frames per second, boasts a 150-degree field of view, and
connects directly to your Wi-Fi network. The Tapo app categorizes motion (person, pet, vehicle) and allows you to set activity
zones and privacy zones. The two-way audio is okay, and there’s a built-in alarm function. You can also slip a microSD card in for
local recording or opt for a Tapo Care subscription (from $3.50/month or $35/year) for 30-day video cloud storage. All that’s
really lacking here is HDR, and this excellent device was runner-up in our guide. —Simon Hill
Do you have a giant plastic bin full of exotic cables you refuse to part with? Yeah, me too. . . A couple of winters ago, I spent
a full day organizing those cables by genre in marked Ziploc bags, which I highly recommend as a satisfying project. It may one
day save me as much as $20 when I need a proprietary charging cable for my MiniDisc player or a standard Micro USB-A cable. To
take that project on in any manner of civilized way you will need these velcro cable ties. —Martin Cizmar
A thermal camera has some handy uses. You can check on the hot water pipes in the wall, see how much heat your mattress is
retaining, and even spot your pet hiding in the dark. Our favorite is the Flir One Gen 3. It looks similar to a little battery
pack, connecting to the base of your phone and turning your phone into a thermal camera via the Flir One app. It does a great job
of creating a visual map of heat and where it could be coming from. It does require a lot of power, though, and you’ll need to
charge it before using it (no, plugging it into your phone doesn’t count). —Nena Farrell
We have an entire in-depth guide all about . Of course, there are all sorts of things to consider, but once you’ve nailed down the
size and specs you want, you might need to pick up some new accessories. If you haven’t upgraded your HDMI cables in a while, this
affordable option from Amazon Basics is worth buying, especially with a few bucks off in honor of Prime Day. Newer cables like
this one may support higher data speeds than those you originally purchased years ago. This 10-foot cable should be plenty long
enough to route behind your TV, but there are additional lengths available too. —Louryn Strampe
Wired cameras are trickier to fit, but you don’t have to worry about battery life. This device is our pick of the best wired , as
it sports a large aperture and image sensor for color footage at night without a spotlight. The motion deception works well, and
you can filter for people, pets, or vehicles—though the AI is a bit flaky—or set up private zones in the Tapo app. Tweak the
default settings, and you can record 2K video with HDR. This camera has an and takes microSD cards up to 512 GB in size for local
I love to read, but after developing cysts in both my wrists, it hasn’t been as comfortable as it used to be, even reading on a
lightweight or an iPhone. But the handy has been the saving grace for my sad, weak wrists. It’s got a clamp base that I can secure
onto my living room side tables or my bed frame base, and then angle the arm towards wherever I’m sitting. It’s also easy to stash
under the bed when I’m not using it, but I tend to just leave it attached to my table of choice so that I can resume reading the
next day with ease. I use it daily with my Kindle Paperwhite, and use it with other devices—my phone, my , even a Steam Deck—to
make reading, scrolling, and gaming pain-free. It’s on sale right now for a few bucks cheaper than usual, and let me tell you,

we’ve tested thanks to its ease of setup, brackets that let you open or close your window deep into the unit when the weather
outside changes, and powerful yet blissfully quiet performance. Skip the heat and bask in the luxury of the cool, now for a
I discovered this fan looking for an easier way to , and it is awesome for blowing dust out of just about anything. It works much
like compressed air for clearing dust and debris from keyboards and computers, but it doesn’t run out. You can set the intensity
with a sliding switch, and it charges via USB-C when the battery is low. It also comes with wee attachments that make it truly
versatile. I’ve used it for detailing the car, blowing crumbs out of the couch, and for dusting everywhere. —Simon Hill
If you want to cool a small space like a tent, RV, or even a small bedroom, the EcoFlow Wave 2 () is a portable AC unit rated at
air conditioning, and it did enough to keep things comfortable. It is portable, though heavy, especially with the add-on battery.
If you can’t plug in, the battery adds up to eight hours of cooling on eco mode. The app is slick, and the Wave 2 is relatively
quiet in operation, delivering effective off-grid cooling or heating (6100 BTU) that you can take with you. But it is pricey, even

The Tushy Classic 3.0 is a pretty low key bidet. While it doesn’t have some of the bells and whistles other bidets have, the Tushy
Classic is easy to install, doesn’t require external power, and is safe to use in a rental or home where you can’t make major
changes. My husband and I love ours—we used my impending birth as an excuse to buy bidets for all our bathrooms, so that way I
wouldn’t need to have a peri bottle handy (postpartum problems). It’s been a great addition to our home long after giving birth,
and they were easy to uninstall from our rental and bring to our new condo, too. I love the bamboo knob finish, but there are tons
of colors to make sure it matches your bathroom’s vibes. —Nena Farrell
I’ve attached about a dozen bidets to my toilet over the past year, and this Kohler PureWash is . If you’ve been shopping for a
bidet attachment and focused on washlets made by Japanese brand Toto, the unquestioned standard-bearer in the category, allow me
to sing the praises of this sleek, minimalist offering from Wisconsin-based Kohler, which is several hundred bucks cheaper than
Totos with the same premium features like a UV sanitization nightlight and on-seat buttons to back up the remote. The sprayer and
dryer work well and it’s a breeze to install using the included metal splitter, which has a sturdy feel compared to Toto’s plastic
pieces. Best of all, the Kohler blends right into my bathroom so it doesn’t look like my toilet is wearing the washroom equivalent
As many of my coworkers have noted, I live in Portland, Oregon, the city with the purest, finest-tasting water in all the land.
This means that I love Lifestraw, because whenever my children and I have to drink water anywhere else in the world, we end up
gagging. I love all of Lifestraw’s products; I use the when we travel, and have recently replaced it with the attractive . But the
most affordable is the personal water filter. Not only does it remove waterborne bacteria and parasites, it also removes
microplastics. Each filter can clean up to 1,000 gallons of water before it needs to be replaced. Even if you don’t normally
venture into life-threatening situations, it’s lightweight and affordable for when you’re traveling in countries where you need to
filter water to brush your teeth, or even just for when your 7-year-old dehydrates himself just because he doesn’t like the taste.
I’m obsessed with smart bird feeders and have tried a few for an upcoming WIRED guide. Bird Buddy’s feeder () is cute and compact
if you’re limited on outdoor space. The connected app snaps pictures of your visitors, using AI to identify the species. I didn’t
try this solar roof version, but I would recommend it to eliminate the need to constantly charge the camera. If you don’t mind it,
or you have another solar charger already, the . —Medea Giordano
Clip the on-page coupon to get an additional 15 percent off. This is another great option and it’s bigger with a nice perch, so
you could potentially get more visitors at once. It’s also more affordable and comes with a lifetime AI subscription so you won’t
have to pay a monthly fee. If you skip the AI, you can get the , and you’ll get video only with the option to add a subscription
later. Since we’ve tested both the Birdfy and Bird Buddy, both AI identification processes have improved and will continue to
I love my son’s Hatch, but if I were shopping for one of my own, this is the one I’d buy. The Hatch Restore 2’s fabric cover and
geometric form factor give it an upscale look and feel, and it comes in three beautiful earth-tone shades. The sunrise light is
directional and bright enough to rouse you from sleep, though you’ll still need a regular lamp to light the entire room. The app
works well to let you customize and organize your sounds and schedules together since it doubles as a sound machine. There’s extra
content behind a $5 monthly membership, but you can get the sunrises, sunsets, and library of sleep sounds all for free. —Nena
This was the first bed frame I ever bought—back when I was furnishing my first apartment and making just above minimum wage. I’ve
since moved on, but the frame is still being circulated among my younger family members. It’s the . The metal tablelike
construction is about as simple as it gets, but the frame is solid and durable. The 18-inch model has enough space underneath for
storage totes. Just get a longer bedskirt if you want them to stay hidden! If you’re also in the market for a , we’ve got a roster
I was helping my sister hunt for a bed frame the other day. She was looking for something simple and affordable, and we were
debating if the IKEA frames were worth hauling ourselves an hour drive for. Then it hit me—she should get my bed frame. I’ve had
the Zinus Platform Metal Bed Frame for five years, and it’s survived four different moves and multiple mattresses top it, but I
always forget how affordable it is since it’s been so sturdy, reliable, and still nice enough to look at for the price. If you’re
looking for a simple bed frame, the Zinus is on sale right now for a nice $33 bucks off. —Nena Farrell
This is easy to move from place to place. It breaks down into a group of metal rods and end pieces, and it’s easy to reassemble
foot of space underneath for under-bed storage (or, in our reviewer’s case, cat tunnels). We also appreciate the recessed side
supports. You won’t stub your toes when crawling into bed. —Louryn Strampe
Casper is the company that brought bed-in-a-box mattresses to prominence stateside, and the Original was the company’s signature
mattress for most of the era. The Original was a mainstay on our guide to the until the launch of the new One, which is now
overall. The Original is still a very solid pick if you’re looking to nab a queen-sized hybrid for just over a grand during Prime
Day. Unlike many of our picks, it’s sold via Amazon if you want fast and free Prime delivery. Depending on where you live, you
could order now and be sleeping on it tomorrow night. —Martin Cizmar
I love grabbing this robe right out of the shower, sometimes even in place of a real towel. The super-plush descriptor is
accurate—this robe is fluffy and cozy, and makes me feel like I’m at a spa resort when I’m really just washing sand out of my hair
after visiting the beach with my toddler. But Brooklinen’s robe isn’t so warm that it’s been too hot to use on summer nights, and
these days I just do a light towel dry before slipping on the robe and letting the robe do the rest of the work. It stays fluffy
after a wash, and while it does shed a little, it’s not much compared to other fluffy towels I’ve tried. I love wearing the
Brooklinen robe while I or wear a before bed, and I am resisting the temptation to add the Resort Stripe color to my collection.
Reviewer Adrienne So described the Sense energy monitor as like a Fitbit for your house in . Unlike the single-outlet versions
WIRED reviewers often use to monitor power consumption by the gadgets we’re testing, this clamps onto your breaker box and gives
you a big-picture look at your power use for various lines. It’s been on sale for $230 before, but if you’ve got an energy drain
that’s running up your power bill it’ll probably pay for itself before long. —Martin Cizmar
Water can cause serious damage, so you want to be immediately alerted when there’s a leak so you can deal with it. The versatile

Automation is what makes a smart home feel smart, and Switchbot’s clever automatic curtain opener, now in its third iteration, is
a retrofit solution to open and close your drapes. Easy to install, with built-in solar panels to keep the battery topped off,
these curtain openers have a “QuietDrift” mode that keeps the noise down. Pair with a Switchbot hub, and you open up full smart
home connectivity. All the flaws of the original Curtain Bot () and Curtain Rod 2 () were fixed in Switchbot Curtain 3, and it
made our guide. You can get another 5 percent off with the code “5OFFNSPDSB.” —Simon Hill
Casper is known for its mattresses, but the company makes a sleek we love with an intuitive design. To start the sunset program
before you go to bed, simply flip the Casper Glow Light over and ta-da! It begins. You’ll use the app to set up details for your
sunset and your sunrise too, such as the length of time for the light to increase or decrease. The sleek little light has dimming
controls, but only one shade of gorgeously yellow light that does a great job evenly lighting a dark room. The Casper Glow Light
is wireless, which is rare, and recharges on a pad the size of a coaster. It’s a chic option if you want great light, a consistent
The LectroFan Classic is for most people, particularly if you just want a few options of colored noise and fan sounds. It’s simply
constructed, with big buttons that are easy to navigate in the dark, and a 60-minute timer. —Medea Giordano
If you need extra drill bits, this is . These general-use drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass
with ease. That should be more than enough for the average DIY-er. There’s a black oxide coating that resists rust and friction to
make short work of your jobs. And the included carrying case keeps everything corralled. The price of this kit frequently bounces
between $17 and $10, and Prime Day brings it down to the low end of the spectrum. Pair this kit with for a one-and-done toolbox
Sometimes a standard Phillips-head screwdriver just isn’t going to cut it. These precision screwdrivers are good to have around

It’s not easy to clean the air in a big room for a low price. The Coway Airmega 250 Smart Air Purifier can exchange the air two
times in a 930-square-foot space and four times in a space half that size. That’s a lot of power in a compact design. here at
WIRED for their power-to-cost ratio. The combination HEPA and activated carbon means the 250 Smart cleans more than just dust and
pollen, it also captures volatile organic compounds. And while it isn’t the quietest air purifier I’ve tested, at full blast it
runs at 54 decibels—comparable to a household refrigerator. The easy-to-view color-coded air quality indicator light quickly tells
me if I have good or bad air. And while it doesn’t connect to an app, nor is it compatible with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant,
the 250 Smart has an unobtrusive warm gray square design that blends into any room. —Lisa Wood Shapiro
As summer continues to heat up at an alarming rate, it’s comforting to know you’ve got an A/C window unit that can do the job.

I prefer having a around for quick cleans, especially if I have to haul it up the stairs. They’re usually not as powerful as an
upright vacuum, and you’re working against battery life, but this Black and Decker was my favorite. It easily picked up Cheerios,
hair, dust, and dirt, and did the best job of cleaning cat litter, which is notorious for getting everywhere like sand no matter
how many times you vacuum over it. It can stand up on its own too, which is a huge win—I hate that most cordless vacs just fall
over if not positioned against something or on a separate stand. —Medea Giordano
We tried The Pink Stuff when it went and it’s safe to say that it’s worth every penny. This bundle gets you the multi-purpose
cleaning spray, the bathroom foam cleaner, and a tub of the Miracle Cleaning Paste. These products successfully remove gunk and
grime from hard-to-clean areas like the stove and the shower, and a little goes a long way so you won’t have to replace it super
frequently. In my opinion, the smell can be a bit … much, but it’s not bad, and the time you’ll save is a worthy trade. —Louryn
If you are looking to get started with , this smart light starter kit from is a great way to do it. You get three bulbs, a smart

and create scenes in the Hue app on your phone. This is the best deal we've seen in a while for this kit, so it’s a good time to
Govee’s Neon Rope Light Strip 2 is one of . It’s gorgeous enough to use as both art and light on just about any wall, without
needing to tuck it behind a TV or console of some kind. Use it to create fun shapes and designs with the help of adhesive-backed
metal brackets (or use the included screws) and bendable clips, and it’s more flexible than the original version to make it easier
to make your cool wall designs. The Neon Rope Light 2 works with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Matter, allowing you to
connect it with Apple HomeKit and Samsung SmartThings via Matter. —Nena Farrell
I finally started using a handheld vacuum for quick messes—knocked over cat food bowls, Cheerios thrown haphazardly all over the
kitchen floor, you get the idea—and I’m angry at myself for not getting one of these sooner. Why wasn’t this on , or my baby
registry? Seriously, people, if you also forgot to put this on one of your registries, take advantage of the handy sale and get
the Shark UltraCyclone now. It’s been so useful to quickly clean up different messes that my tiny mammals love to make everywhere
in our home, and nice to grab in between full-on runs of the (mainly since my kid is afraid of the robot vacuum, but not of my
handheld Shark). I’m trying to keep the ants away, and the Shark is my partner in crime for the job. The battery life also is
solid enough for usually three or four short cleanings. —Nena Farrell
Like most robot vacuum manufacturers these days, Roborock has a truly bewildering array of offerings at various price points and
with different features. The Q Revo line is the company’s midrange line, with slightly less suction (7000Pa) versus the high-end
SQ MaxV Ultra at 10,000Pa. The Q Revo S is the update to last year’s Q Revo, which I tested and has slightly less suction at
might end up just balding your carpets. Altogether, there isn’t a ton of differences in the Q Revo line versus Yeedi’s at this
point; they have the same lidar navigation system, and the apps even look very similar. The Q Revo S doesn’t have an extendable
arm, and the base is a few inches taller than the Yeedi, if you plan on sticking it under a convenient shelf. However, it is on
sale for cheaper than Yeedi’s high-end vac and overall I have found the Q Revo to be a reliable, if a bit noisy, cleaning partner.
The Yeedi M12 Pro+ is the high end of Yeedi’s product line. Like Roborock before it, I have been shocked by the improvement in
Yeedi’s software and hardware over the past few years. The cleaning station has a new sleek look and is remarkably compact,
considering that it comes with a self-emptying dust bin and two huge, 4-liter water tanks—one for clean water, and one for dirty.
The helpful but still creepy extendable arm reaches into every nook and cranny to mop, and the dock now has a hot air dryer so
that the mop pads don’t get moldy. After several weeks, I even sniffed them to see and they still smelled clean (the things we do
for testing). You can even start a cleaning session by tapping the bumper with your foot, although with a new puppy in the house
this is not as convenient a feature as you might think. I genuinely regret to say that getting a premium robot vacuum mop for
under $800 is a steal in this economy. If you’re in the tax bracket that’s considering hiring a house cleaner, this is a purchase
that will help you put off that decision for a little longer. —Adrienne So
Last year’s T9+ () was the midrange option in Ecovacs’ Deebot lineup, so at $370 this is a bit of a steal. A year on, it still has

frequently than a slightly more high-end mop-vac though. —Adrienne So
One of the , the Eufy S350 is incredibly versatile, though it is likely overkill for most folks. This dual-lens camera combines a
regular 4K camera with a 130-degree field of view with a 2K telephoto lens that supports 3x optical zoom. You can pan 360 degrees
and tilt 75 degrees. There is also AI tracking with up to four preset positions it can patrol, privacy mode, two-way audio, and
onboard AI to detect people, pets, and sounds. You can record locally with a microSD card up to 128 GB or HomeBase 3 (both sold
separately). The relatively low frame rate (15) and sometimes slow-loading feed take the shine off a little, but it’s pretty

Eufy pioneered the dual camera design for video doorbells, enabling you to see visitors and packages on your doorstep by offering
a split view or combining the two lenses into a single view of your entire porch. The E340 is the right now. It is an improved
version of the original Eufy Video Doorbell Dual () and does not need a hub (it has 8GB of internal storage). The 2K footage is
generally crisp and clear, and the onboard AI detects people and packages (it can even recognize faces, though not always
accurately). It is discounted often, but we have never seen it this low. —Simon Hill
With a self-emptying bin, smart AI navigation, and mopping capability, the Eufy X10 Pro Omni () is a great choice for busy family
homes. It can handle multiple floors, recognizes and avoids obstacles, and is very good at mopping hard floors, according to WIRED
editor Adrienne So. Emptying the water tank is never fun, but at least you don’t have to do it very often. The X10 Pro Omni made
our guide as the best affordable vacuum mop. The lowest price we have seen previously was $680, so this is a good discount. —Simon
Skylight Frames are another great , especially if they’re on sale cheaper than Aura. You get high-quality images and an
easy-to-function app, it’s just not quite as polished and simple as Aura. If it comes down to aesthetics, go with the one you
I have no idea how or why the Scrub Daddy became “America’s favorite sponge,” and every time I think about clicking into a story
about them I cringe so hard my fingers seize up. However, I bought one and the Scrub Daddy is a truly great sponge. It’s hard
before you soak it if you want to scrape off some tough gunk, then it soaks up some water and becomes softer and more pliable to
get into tough-to-reach places. It remains unsmelly for a remarkably long time. It’s normally pretty expensive for a sponge, which
makes it a popular Prime Day buy when you see deals like megapack of 12 for $37. You can get a more modest savings on . —Martin
I’ve now tried around a dozen brands and none have come close to beating the quality and ease of use of Aura. The screens simply
look the best—photos are high quality but not overly shiny like they look on an iPad or smart display—and the app is polished and
easy to navigate and share with family members. The is our top recommendation because it’s also the most affordable from the
brand, but this version of the Carver has a mat border if you prefer that style. —Medea Giordano
The Dreame X30 Ultra has been dragged from my carpet-covered apartment to my vinyl-planked condo, and it has done an amazing job
in both places whether it's vacuuming or mopping. The coolest trick it has, and the reason behind the steep price tag, is that it
can remove its own mop pads when it goes to vacuum carpet or a rug so that it doesn't drag the damp pads all over your fabric
flooring of choice. It can also just raise up the mop pads, but I'd prefer to keep my mop water away from my white rug, thank you
very much, and the X30 makes that possible. It's a serious splurge, but it's got a great discount for Prime Day. —Nena Farrell
When I bought my daughter the Magical Mixies cauldron for Christmas three years ago I had no idea these toys would turn into a
whole extended universe with a and a . The lineup of toys is very popular with elementary-age kids who go through potion packs as
fast as Sunny D squeeze pouches. And you can save some dough on this Marena doll this Prime Day. —Martin Cizmar
The Nanit Pro () is a powerhouse monitor, and it’s one of my favorite out there. Using Wi-Fi and the Nanit app, the Nanit turns
your smartphone into a baby monitor, constantly playing the sound from your baby’s room through your smartphone’s speakers while
you go about your evening—no more making sure you remembered to move the separate baby monitor when you went from the kitchen to
your bedroom. It has cool tricks, too, like being able to track baby’s breathing and growth, and puts together a fun little recap
of each evening. I love the floor stand since it gives you a great above view of your kiddo in the crib instead of a side angle
without needing any hardware on the walls. The only downside is the floor stand is pricey, but right now it’s on sale for a
fantastic price. If you prefer to install your monitor on the wall to keep it away from grabby toddler hands, . —Nena Farrell
If you want to keep an eye on your baby’s vitals at night, the Owlet’s Dream Duo 2 gives you both a regular video baby monitor and
a wearable sock, so you can both see them through the camera and track the baby's heart rate and oxygen level. The app and monitor
can also tell you the temperature, humidity, and noise level in the baby's room, which is nice to keep an eye on. It’s a ton of
information, basically, so if you’re a data nerd and worried about a baby’s vitals, this wearable monitor might be just what you
need. The entry-level sock is designed for up to 18 months old, and while there’s a design for older ages, it’s really designed
for those early days (and for babies who can’t remove the sock on their own). —Nena Farrell
I wasn’t always a percale fan, but after trying out percale sheets in the summertime, they’ve become one of my go-to .
Brooklinen’s percale is my personal favorite, as their percale is crisp and light, allowing for lots of airflow, but still
slightly soft and not overly papery to the touch.. I especially love all the beautiful colors it comes in, and you can get the
brand’s percale in a duvet cover too if you want a more breathable top layer. Brooklinen’s running a surprise sale on their site,
so even though you can find Brooklinen on Amazon, you’ll actually want to go to Brooklinen’s site to find their Prime Day deals.
The Plufl () might be the most asked about product I’ve ever tested. Everyone who came over made a comment, asking if I suddenly
adopted a Great Dane. No, this bed was actually for me and if you too love to lounge, consider the Plufl. The memory foam is
comfortable and the cover is super soft, so it’s easy to get nice and cozy in this thing whether I’m napping, reading, or watching
TV. My cats like to join me too. The brand has now released an . —Medea Giordano
If you have cats, you know that their bathroom habits are important to monitor to catch signs of potential illnesses (some of
which can be quickly fatal). I love the Petivity (), which sits underneath any standard litter box and, through the connected app,
tells me which cat went to the bathroom when, what they did, and how much they weigh. I get some peace of mind knowing I have one
The CubiAi is one of our . It has great in-depth detection, and can send you alerts not only if it sees a baby move, but can also
detect when your baby's face is covered with a blanket (and just a reminder, they should be at least a year old before a blanket
is in the crib with them!) or if the baby has rolled over, which you’ll want to fix immediately if your little one isn’t strong
enough to lift their head up. But my favorite part is how the CuboAi Plus is designed to look like a little bird, and can even
make some bird-chirping alert sounds–a fun addition for any nursery. It’s on sale on both Cubo’s site and Amazon’s, but the price
is better if you go to Cubo’s own site. —Nena Farrell

Vegetable choppers and slicers like these are great to have around when you’re prepping a ton of fresh ingredients. I especially
like them for onions—all the stinkiness, slipperiness, and teary eyes get obliterated by one swing and press of the chopper.
They’re also nice to have when you need really uniform sizes. This comes with a few different plates for different slicing and
chopping styles, plus a storage case and cleaning brushes. Every part is dishwasher safe. —Louryn Strampe
If you’ve got a , this is an easy way to prep fruits and vegetables—even if there’s minimal prep space. This food processor has a

of processing, but the trade-off is worthwhile when working in small spaces. —Louryn Strampe
This is the only knife sharpener you need. It's simple and easy to use, takes no practice and puts a nice edge on every blade I've
tested. For $97 you can permanently banish dull knives. Everyone wants sharp knives. Dull knives are dangerous. But here's the
thing, sharpening knives is difficult. And I say this as someone who has worked in restaurant kitchens and sharpened many knives
on a daily basis. It takes practice to get good at and you forget it quickly. These days, I rarely reach for my expensive stones,
the Tumbler rolling sharpener does 99 percent of the same, doesn't require any real skill, and takes half as long. —Scott
If you’re considering a home composter, this one from Vitamix is one of the most even without the discount. You can keep the
larger part of the machine stashed somewhere out of the way, and instead leave just the chamber on the counter until it’s full.
Then put the chamber back in and start the process. It struggled to grind some coffee pods and tougher food waste, though. —Medea
Stasher bags are some of the out there. Rather than using individual plastic disposable bags, you can use these dishwasher- and
microwave-safe resealable versions again and again. A , but this starter kit would be good if you want to snag multiple sizes.
You’ll get six different bags ranging from tiny snack bags all the way to a half-gallon one. And the colors are cute! —Louryn
regularly jumps between $200 and $130, but we haven’t seen it drop lower than $130 since Black Friday 2023. It’s not just an air
fryer—the Ninja Speedi has other functions too, like searing, sauteing, roasting, baking, and more. There’s even a sous-vide
function. Our tester especially liked this appliance’s efficient use of space. You can adjust the inner rack to cook a grain on
the bottom and roast meat on the top, and the compact overall design means it won’t take up too much space on your countertop.
All kitchen gadget trends are cyclical, but I thought the sous vide trend was on the decline until a few days ago when a
trend-conscious friend sent me a link to about using an Anova sous vide cooker to meal prep for a week in about an hour. Sous vide
cookers are indeed great gadgets and I’ve made lots of great meals with my Anova, as the company makes very solid devices that
hold temperature well and feel plenty sturdy. I have an older Anova model than the Nano but have consulted several professional
reviews which say this is the one to get now. —Martin Cizmar
Vitamix is often a name that comes out on top in any for,good reason. Powerful and built to last, Vitamix blenders are simple to
use but very,effective. I use my Vitamix E310 Explorian blender regularly to blitz pancake mix for,breakfast and it comes in handy
when the kids come home from school hungry and,want a frozen-berry smoothie. As its blending jar is generous, I find it easy to
pack in,the ingredients and leave it to smoothly pulverize the goods. It does well to,effortlessly pull food down to its powerful
blade so there’s little need for me to,intervene by shaking the jar like you have to with some blenders. Chunky vegetables,go down

Owalas and Stanleys have become the new it bottles, but Hydro Flask was popular with the youth and outdoorsy folks long before

Zojirushi’s travel mug is known for its ability to keep drinks scalding hot for hours and hours. Sometimes too hot to drink. The
lid locks so it won’t spill that lava liquid all over you. It doesn’t make because the lid has three parts each with hard-to-clean
deep ridges, but if that doesn’t bother you and you need heat longevity above all else, it’s a great choice. —Medea Giordano
Every year I see people recommending Lodge’s 10- and as Prime Day “deals”. People, these pans are permanently on sale. The 10-inch
is always $20, and the 12-inch is always $30. I actually think those are fair prices for these pans, but they aren’t some special
you’re going to miss out on. Trust me. Or trust Camel Camel Camel, which tracks Amazon prices. Here’s for the last six months of

The , Breville’s Barista Express produces consistent pressure for espresso, steams milk with an easily adjustable steam wand, and
even grinds beans for you. It’s a coffee shop on your counter. Just like its more expensive siblings (we also like the ), the
Barista Express builds up water pressure gradually, ensuring a smooth and even extraction. Its sturdy, mostly-metal construction
and easy cleaning have also helped make it a popular choice for several years now and a longtime favorite of ours. WIRED reviews
editor Julian Chokkattu has been using one with no issues for five years. —Scott Gilbertson
The Café Barista is a downgraded version of our favorite espresso machine, the Mr. Coffee One-Touch Coffeehouse. The Barista is
better for those who want a machine that mixes the milk for you without much fuss. It cranks out fairly rich single or double-size
espressos, cappuccinos, and lattes with the push of a button. The downside is that this one is more plasticky and lightweight then
higher priced machines, which means you really have to steady the machine with your hand as you twist the portafilter into place.
Oxo’s Brew grinder is our top budget grinder. It has a good balance of features, usefulness, and a relatively low price among the
electric grinders we’ve tested. It’s a conical burr grinder, so it gives you the precision for most types of brewing. There are 15
settings, covering every brewing scenario from finely ground espresso to coarse-ground that’s perfect for a French press. Its
slim, narrow profile doesn’t hog counter space—though it is 16 inches tall and might be a tight fit under the cabinets. —Scott
Breville’s Barista Touch includes a built-in burr grinder, a hot water spout, and a digital display. It’s aimed at the home
barista who wants to program in their own custom drinks and access them at the touch of a button. With the Barista Touch, you can
just hit the Latte button and have it whip up a latte. It’ll even foam the milk—not as well as you can do it manually, but it’s a
Fellow’s Stagg EKG gooseneck kettle is kettle. The long spout looks like a goose’s neck, and makes it perfect for pour-over coffee
because it gives you precise control when pouring. That said, it’s great for just about anything. We love it for brewing tea as
well. There’s a smart version, the EKG+, complete with Fellow’s iOS companion app (there’s no Fellow Android app, but you can use
the Acaia Brewmaster app). The app functionality is minimal (and is generally clunky). You can use it to turn the kettle on and
off, change the temperature, and keep an eye on it without needing to head to the kitchen. That’s about it. We recommend skipping
the “smart” version and sticking with the regular Fellow Stagg EKG to save some cash. —Scott Gilbertson
This De’Longhi espresso machine () has a nice slim profile which makes it fit just about any counter. It includes an excellent
quality burr grinder, and produces consistently wonderful espresso with nice crema. Just don’t buy it for the cold brew feature
because it doesn’t work very well. Otherwise though, this is a nice machine. —Scott Gilbertson

The Paperwhite is the , and frankly, . The Paperwhite is fast so you get minimal delay between pages, brighter with adjustable
warm light, and waterproof. Plus, 16 gigabytes holds thousands of books. If you upgrade to the , you’ll get 32 gigs of storage,
wireless charging, and an auto-adjusting backlight. For $20 more, you can forgo ads on the lockscreen, but they shouldn’t disturb
your actual reading. These haven’t been updated since 2021 and we’re not sure when a new version is coming. Still, Kindles tend to
last for years longer than most tech devices and Prime Day is the time to get the best price. My Paperwhite from that year is

naturally. Unfortunately, you can’t write directly on books like you can on a . Instead, you have to use sticky notes. Confusingly
Folks seeking a simple mesh Wi-Fi system that’s easy to set up and use will enjoy the Eero 6. This dual-band Wi-Fi 6 mesh is
suitable for relatively undemanding households with internet connections up to 500 Mbps, as discussed in our . The Eero Plus
subscription is quite costly at $10 per month or $100 per year, but it adds enhanced security, comprehensive parental controls,
and handy extras like a password manager and VPN service. The Eero 6 is our pick for smart homes in our because it can double up
as a smart home hub with support for the Matter, Thread, and Zigbee smart home standards. —Simon Hill
It’s still a bit early for most folks to consider Wi-Fi 7, but because Wi-Fi 7 systems are hitting the market, we are seeing
rapidly falling prices on routers. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E () is one of the , offering super speedy, if short range, 6-GHz Wi-Fi,
handy smart home hub functionality, and compatibility with other Eero devices. The Eero Plus subscription is pricey at $10 a month

cheapest price we’ve ever seen for the three-pack, enough to cover up to 6,000 square feet. —Simon Hill
Amazon’s top-of-the-line battery doorbell delivers high-quality, crisp video with HDR support and color night vision, swift and
accurate notifications, and good two-way audio. I love the option to set multiple motion zones, including a potentially handy
bird’s-eye zone that lets you define range. The handy preroll feature captures a few seconds before each clip. The catch is you
must subscribe to Ring Protect for $5/month ($50/year) for a single camera to get 180-day video storage, rich notifications, and
person and package detection. Battery life was also disappointing (three weeks). It got an honorable mention in our guide. —Simon
The Echo Pop () is a geometric little speaker that’s easy to pop anywhere on your desk, shelves, or bedside table. I often have
the Echo Pop out on display in my office since it’s so cute to look at with its half-moon shape, and the colorful shades of
lavender and midnight teal are ones you won’t find on any other Amazon speaker (it comes in the classic black and white, too, if
those are more your speed). It has a nice enough sound for the price point, though it lacks bass, and it’s especially a great
speaker when you can find it on sale like you can right now. It often drops to a little over $20, but $18 is better than we
usually find it for. I like it for jamming to electronic lo-fi and pop playlists while I write all day, so if those are your go-to
There’s the Amazon Echo ecosystem, then there’s the Amazon Echo. What started as the tubular first-ever smart speaker is now the
rounded fourth-generation Amazon Echo (). The latest generation has been around for four years now, and it’s still one of our
given the detailed, room-filling sound, easy use as an Alexa-powered speaker, and great price point given the sound power packed
into it. The rounded shape also gives it better acoustic abilities than the towerlike one did, and it gets much louder than
similar smart speakers. It’s already a great price for all its features, and now it’s nearly half off, so don’t miss your chance
There’s always at least one Echo Show 8 somewhere in my house. I just moved, and the first smart speaker I set up was the
third-gen Show 8 in my kitchen, where it’s become the downstairs DJ, weather station, and smart home hub. The Show 8 might be the
middle child of Amazon’s smart display speakers, but it’s my favorite one Amazon makes and the one I recommend for Amazon users.
It’s a perfect size to read recipes and the weather without taking up a ton of space, has a nice robust sound and good bass for
the small size, and can even double as a security camera. It’s even got a built-in smart home hub to connect devices directly to
it, rather than needing a third-party hub. Honestly, what can’t it do? —Nena Farrell
The Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) reminds me of Wall-E in a charming kind of way. The smart display screen sits atop a rounded base, and
it uses its camera and microphone to follow your voice and face around the room when you ask questions, are reading a recipe, or
are video chatting with a friend. It’ll do its best to keep you centered on the screen, too, though it’ll take some zooming
liberties to pull it off. It works pretty well, and is both a little charming and a little silly as it swivels around to try and
follow you around. If you have a kitchen you’re constantly moving around in and can’t decide which way your smart speaker will
need to face, the Echo Show 10 can solve that for you. It sounds fantastic, too, thanks to the large speaker base. —Nena Farrell
The Echo Show 5 is the baby bear of Amazon’s smart display lineup. With just a 5-inch screen, it looks a bit like a smartphone on
its side, but with a camera in the center and speaker base behind it. I like the pint-sized option for bedrooms, since the screen
will switch off whatever screen saver you’ve chosen to be a dark-mode clock with soft red numbers to make it easy on your eyes and
not light up the entire room. It can still do everything the larger screens can do, but I find this screen size is really best for
weather reports and clocks rather than video chatting or recipe reading. But it can still do it all. —Nena Farrell
The Echo Dot is small but mighty. The pint-sized speaker fits just about anywhere thanks to its small size but still has clear
sound and good microphones built into it to pick up your voice, play music, and answer your various questions for Alexa. (Do I ask
for the weather twice in a row because I wasn’t listening the first time? Yes, I do.) The Echo Dots have been popular for years
thanks to the small size and cheaper price tag, but the 5th generation is the best one yet, and half off is hard to beat. There’s
also the slightly more expensive that’s great for bedside tables. —Nena Farrell
If you love Amazon’s smart speakers but want the best sound money can buy, the Amazon Echo Studio is the speaker to buy,
especially now that it’s on sale for Prime Day. The 350 watts of power and a downward-firing subwoofer are impressive for a
speaker this size, and there’s both an upward-firing midrange speaker and two side-facing ones. That design means the Echo Studio
is capable of playing 3D audio codecs that are usually limited to Dolby Atmos speakers, which is pretty cool. It still has
everything else we love about an Amazon Echo speaker built into it, too, on top of these fantastic sound features. It’s one to
jump for if you like asking Alexa for the weather, but want the best sound when you ask her to turn up the music. —Nena Farrell
Amazon’s Blink Mini 2 () is the newest model of its security camera. It’s compact, but still captures crisp 1080p HD video and

We prefer the Blink Mini 2 (), since it has a handful of handy upgrades, but the original Blink Mini is even more affordable if
you’re on a tight budget or only need an indoor camera versus an indoor-outdoor option. For such a cheap price, there’s still
plenty of features: 1080p HD video, motion detection (and the ability to make motion detection zones), two-way audio, and either
cloud or local storage depending on if you add on the ($50) and a or get the subscription. It also pairs nicely with an Amazon
Blink Video Doorbell, since the Blink Mini can double as a doorbell chime inside your home. —Nena Farrell
Amazon’s Blink Video Doorbell is . The video quality is nothing exciting, and you won’t get the same detailed notifications or
video clips you would on more expensive models. But the fact that it can run for months on just two AA batteries makes it easy to
set up and keep powered without needing any special battery sizes or wiring. It works with existing doorbell writing too, if your
abode has that on offer. It’s especially exciting that the doorbell plus the Sync Module 2 ($50) are on sale together for such a
good price, because the Sync Module means that you can skip out on the monthly subscription fee and store video locally. Just grab
a USB drive to put into the Sync Module 2 and you’re good to go. —Nena Farrell
Smart plugs all work pretty similarly. Amazon’s Smart Plug works exactly as you expect it to: You plug things into it (A lamp! A
TV! A light strip you lost the remote to!) and can remotely control the power. Amazon’s smart plug is nice if you want a guarantee
to never need another app outside of your Alexa app. You’d set it up within the same app your other Amazon products, like an Echo
speaker, are set up with. It’s worth noting that several work with the protocol and won’t require an app anymore to immediately
connect with your Alexa. But ultimately, if you’re an Alexa user, going with the smart plug designed to work with her is a nice
safe bet. The smart plug works well and is my recommendation if you know you’re going to only use it with Alexa, ever. —Nena
I just started testing the newest addition to . The Echo Spot is like a larger Echo Pop () with the same half-moon shape, but has
a small screen on half of its rounded front. Amazon describes it as a smart alarm clock and its default screen face is a clock,
but the screen can also show you the weather and what song you have it playing. So far, the Spot has pretty full-bodied sound as I
blast Chappel Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess from it while I write about deals all day long. The bass is solid for
the small size, which I was impressed by. It’s brand new, but currently on sale for nearly half off. —Nena Farrell

Snail mucin on TikTok last year, due in part to . I’m a longtime fan—snail mucin is soothing, hydrating, and overall helps my skin

or after an event when I’m taking off my mask. My lips have never been smoother or more supple. The consistency is super
luxurious, the scents and flavors are light, and there’s no tint. My only complaint is that it’s easy to lose the tiny included
spatula. If fingers in your product tubs bother you, consider purchasing a . —Louryn Strampe

The Solawave wand is a good buy for someone who wants to try but isn’t sold on the idea of spending $400 or more on a full mask.
It combines the LEDs with warmth and vibrations that genuinely just feel good to use. Two WIRED staffers said they saw visibly
tighter skin, particularly around their eyes, after a few weeks of use. But because of its small size, you have to be even more
diligent with how often you use it to see results. If you’re hoping for a full face transformation, just get a mask. —Medea
You wouldn’t think steam would be a friend to . Yet the Steampod actually helps to infuse moisture into your locks while ironing
it straight and then dries just the outer part of the hair shaft. This basically locks the hair so unwanted moisture doesn’t seep
in once it's set, so humidity shouldn’t cause frizziness the moment you step outside. It didn’t give our tester the poker straight

I haven’t used this specific Waterpik before, but the brand’s products all work the same. They’re like a pressure washer for the
gunk between your teeth. They’re also faster than flossing. They can be great for folks who forget to floss since the process is
so quick. There are seven different tips, which means multiple household members can use the device. The machine features 10
pressure settings, and the reservoir holds enough water for 90 seconds’ worth of flossing time. —Louryn Strampe
The Braun Series 9 is . Our tester notes that the quality of accessories is well above average, and if you’re paranoid that you
might change settings while shaving your face, this trimmer is equipped with two safety measures. The control dial would be hard

This makes our list of for its luxury finishes. It’s not the most expensive of our favorites, but it still trades out plastic for
hefty metal that feels substantial in your hand. The bottom is sturdy enough to let it stand on its own, too, without a separate
piece keeping it steady. Our tester found that the steel blade system was a bit harsh on his skin over plastic, though. —Medea
Therabody makes some of , and the Sense is a reasonably priced option (for the brand, at least). It’s nearly silent, so you can
use it at home, the gym, or maybe even at the office without annoying everyone around you. It has an LCD screen for controls and
guided routines, and a breathwork feature with a heart rate monitor—you can find these in the very expensive too. The Sense has
three fewer attachments than the Pro Plus, but most people won’t need all that excess. The pared-down Theragun Relief is even
cheaper, but is only available from and . —Medea Giordano
Therabody’s massage guns are its most popular recovery items, but I love the band’s Smart Goggles (). A combination of vibration,
massage, and heat ease away eye pain and headaches, or simply give you 20 minutes of relaxation anytime you need it. It’s a pricey
accessory, but if you suffer from frequent headaches like I do, it could be worth the money, especially on sale. —Medea Giordano
If you’re looking for a complete hair tool kit, the Dyson AirWrap () is one to snag today. This is the Amazon Exclusive Bundle,
but it still comes with the same nine tools and attachments as the regular kit you’d find on Dyson’s own site, plus it comes with
a storage bag and a detangling comb. This variety pack of attachments makes it easy to do all kinds of hair styles, and also has
the ability to wrap your hair around its barrel attachment all on its own. It’s featured in our and our list of the for a reason,

Suri’s electric toothbrush is a , with soft bristles and gentle vibrations. There are cheaper ones that I like better, however
Suri stands out for its sustainability efforts. Electric toothbrushes, in general, are less wasteful than regular ones because you
just need to replace brush heads, and Suri for you. Though hopefully the battery and motor last a while, they too will eventually
give out. When that happens, Suri can often repair them and if not (or if you don’t want it back) it will recycle the whole thing.

I’m not the biggest fan of Apple’s standard AirPods (), but they do work impeccably well with iPhones, iPads, and other Apple
products, and some folks find them to be just about the only earbuds that fit in their ears (looking at you, reviewer Martin
Cizmar). This is the cheapest they usually get, so now is a great time to buy them. —Parker Hall
This is now the most feature-packed Apple Pencil. It looks identical to the second-generation version—matte finish and all—but
with a few new noteworthy features. There’s a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (in addition to double-tap), as
well as a haptic engine inside that delivers feedback whenever you squeeze the stylus. There’s also a built-in gyroscope sensor
that allows you to change the orientation of the tools as you twist the stylus (which allows for finer control). It supports
Apple’s Find My Network as well, so if you accidentally lose it, you can use your Apple device to find it. However, it’s only
compatible with the company’s latest and . It’s pricey, but it’s the best option if you use your iPad for mainly sketching and
The 1st-Gen Apple Pencil has been around for almost a decade, but it still works well. It’s also compatible with a handful of
iPads including the base model (6th-Gen and later) iPad Mini (5th-Gen), iPad Air (3rd-Gen) iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st- and 2nd-Gen),
iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad Pro 9.7-inch. It comes with various features too, including tilt sensitivity (for shading), pressure
sensitivity (where the lines get thicker as you press harder on the display), and handwriting support within search fields and
apps (like Notes). It dips to this price frequently, but we still think it’s a solid deal. —Brenda Stolyar
AirTags are our favorite for iPhone users. They’re about the size of a quarter, and Apple offers a variety of that allow you to
attach them to everything, including keys, bags, pet collars, and more. In addition to Bluetooth, it also uses Apple’s U1
location-finding chip that helps you pinpoint your item’s exact location via the Find My app. Using the app, you can walk around
with your phone, and, using the phone’s accelerometer, gyroscope, and camera, it’ll direct you right toward the missing item. The
Find My network, while giant, is also anonymous and end-to-end encrypted. —Brenda Stolyar
The M2-powered iPad Air () came out only two months ago, but it’s already on sale. I love the new 13-inch solely for its bigger
and brighter display. I’ve been using it as a secondary display to work off of during the day and watch TV before bed—both of
which make for great viewing experiences. Under the hood is an M2 processor, which is the same one that powers the 13-inch Macbook
Air and MacBook Pro from 2022. Equipped with an 8-core CPU and 9-core GPU, Apple claims it’s 50 percent faster than the M1-powered
version. I didn’t notice a huge difference coming from the M1 chip, but regardless, the iPad Air delivered smooth performance even
with various apps running simultaneously. You’ll likely notice a difference if you’re coming from an older A-series chip though.
As with its predecessor, it also packs slim bezels, a USB-C port, and Touch ID built into the top power button. The only
difference is that Apple finally moved the front-facing 12-megapixel camera to landscape orientation. —Brenda Stolyar
Be sure to select the on-page coupon for an extra $50 off. The 2024 MacBook Air is for most people and this is the best price
we’ve seen yet. It’s a light, thin, and reliable laptop with a powerful M3 chip. It’s not a huge upgrade from the previous
version’s M2, but if you’re working on an older M1 model, you’ll notice an upgrade. The Air has a 13.6-inch screen and,
thankfully, a variety of ports—two USB 4/Thunderbolt ports, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, and a MagSafe port for charging. —Medea
The iPad 10th-Gen () was never our top choice, mainly because it was too expensive for a basic iPad and the iPad ninth-gen was a
better value. But ever since Apple discontinued the ninth-generation version and reduced the price of this iPad by $100, the 10th
gen is for most people. It comes with a variety of notable upgrades, including slimmer bezels around a larger 10.9-inch Liquid
Retina (IPS LCD) display, a USB-C port instead of Lightning, a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button, a 12-megapixel
rear camera (up from 8 megapixels), and, most important, the 12-MP selfie camera has been moved to the center of the iPad—which
means you’ll no longer have to stare awkwardly to the side during video calls. It’s powered by Apple’s A14 Bionic chip, which is
also found in the iPhone 12, which delivers slightly faster performance and a bump in graphics over its predecessor. —Brenda
The iPad Mini () is my favorite tablet to travel with. The 8.3-inch display is great for a variety of activities including
watching movies, reading ebooks, sketching, and notetaking (it packs support for the second-generation Apple Pencil). With a
modern design, the iPad Mini also has Touch ID built into the power button, a USB-C charging port, and the front-facing camera is
equipped with Center Stage (which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame while on video calls). Under the hood is the same A15
Bionic processor that powers the iPhone 13 lineup, so it’ll easily handle taxing apps or games. It is, however, worth noting, that
this model came out in 2021. Apple is expected to announce the next-generation version in September or early next year. So, I
Apple's latest iPad Pro tablets () pack the largest notable upgrades we've seen in a long time. The larger version has a slightly
bigger and brighter display, at 13 inches, with an upgraded OLED screen (an improvement from mini-LED). The camera systems are a
bit different too. Rather than a dual-camera module on the back, you’ll get a single 12-megapixel wide camera, a lidar scanner,
and a new adaptive True Tone flash (which improves document scanning). Meanwhile, the front-facing camera has been moved to
landscape mode. This is also, so far, the only device powered by the all-new M4 chip. I didn’t notice a major difference in
performance compared to the M2 in its predecessor, but it felt smooth, snappy, and responsive, nonetheless. We originally
recommended holding off on this iPad Pro, in case Apple announced any groundbreaking features for iPadOS 18 at , but none of the
upcoming capabilities are exclusive to this chip. We still recommend the M2-powered iPad Pro over this one, because it’s overkill.
But if you want the latest and greatest, we highly suggest snagging it only when it’s on sale—as in, right now. —Brenda Stolyar
This used to be the most feature-packed Apple Pencil until the Apple Pencil Pro was announced a couple of months ago. As with the
first-gen version, it comes with pressure sensitivity, tilt sensitivity, and handwriting support. There’s a double-tap feature
too, which lets you switch quickly between tools by tapping on the Apple Pencil twice. You’ll also get wireless pairing and
wireless charging (the stylus automatically charges magnetically when attached to the top edge of supported iPads). It’s
compatible with the iPad Air (4th-Gen and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st-Gen and later) and the 12.9-inch (3rd-Gen and later), and
This is a great wireless charger if you own multiple Apple gadgets. It has a T-shaped design that suspends two of your devices
midair, including your iPhone (at the fastest 15-watt charging speed Apple allows), and it can fast-charge your Apple Watch
case). Belkin has since come out with a ($150) with Qi2 certification—the latest wireless charging standard, which you can learn
more about in . It’s fairly similar to this version, aside from a more rounded base and an iPhone charging pad that tilts to your
preferred angle (with the option to flip it into landscape mode to watch a video or trigger ). —Brenda Stolyar
The Symmetry Series+ Case holds the title of Best Overall in our . The mix of synthetic rubber and polycarbonate is durable, the
raised edges around the display are higher than many other basic cases, and the buttons are satisfying to press. It has a strong
MagSafe connection too. Overall, the case is protective without feeling clunky or adding too much weight. It looks stylish too,
specifically in the lime green color, but there are also plenty of other colors to pick from. This case is for the iPhone 13 and
iPhone 14, but it’s also available for the . —Brenda Stolyar
At WIRED, we’re fans of OtterBox cases. Throughout the years, several members of the Gear Team have had and tested OtterBox cases,

This is our favorite keyboard case in our guide to the . It’s composed of two pieces. The first half covers the back of the iPad
and comes equipped with a kickstand, while the second half is a detachable keyboard with a trackpad. The versatility is great for
those who use their iPads to get work done during the day and watch TV at night. It’s sturdy, durable, feels nice to type on (the
backlight keys are a nice touch too), and it connects via Apple’s Smart Connector instead of Bluetooth. It’s compatible with a
variety of iPad models including the base iPad (7th-, 8th-, and 9th-Gen) and the iPad Air (5th-Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro
noting that if you’re buying this for the 13-inch iPad Pro, it does add a lot of weight to the tablet. Although I typically
wouldn’t complain about this, it’s tough to ignore seeing as how the latest iPad Pro is lighter and thinner than ever. —Brenda
This is part of a broader 20 percent off Moft sale on all its and mobile accessories. I really like the Snap Phone Tripod Stand—it
uses MagSafe, so it’ll work with any iPhone that supports MagSafe. The magnets are really strong, and you can practically put your
handset in any angle. It’s quick to get used to how it works, super lightweight, and an excellent travel companion if you
regularly find yourself recording videos or selfies and want a way to prop your device up. —Julian Chokkattu
There’s no denying that iPhone screens are relatively delicate, regardless of how much Apple claims it’s improved the device’s
durability. Whether you’re worried about scratching or shattering your phone, a screen protector is a great option—as long as it’s
easy to install. The Smartish Tuff Sheet is a great choice. It comes in a two-pack, so you’ll have another one on hand when you
need to swap it. You’ll also get an alcohol wipe, dust removal stickers, and a microfiber cloth to clean your screen ahead of
installation. And, with the included applicator tool, the entire process is foolproof. We did have some air bubbles appear after
installing it on our iPhone, but they quickly disappeared. —Brenda Stolyar
This wireless keyboard case from Zagg is thanks to its comfortable keyboard and detachable protective case if you want to keep
your iPad protected without having to carry the keyboard around with you, too. The touchpad isn’t quite as spacious as some other
models we’ve tested, but it’s still plenty to get basic work done. This case/keyboard combo comes in variations that fit most 10-
to 12-inch iPads, so make sure you get the right one that fits your device. —Eric Ravenscraft
If you’re a fan of Apple’s StandBy mode, the iOS 17 feature that turns your iPhone into a smart display on your nightstand, then
you’ll love this wireless charger from Twelve South. The 3-in-1 charger gives your iPhone more than enough room to sit in
landscape mode, therefore triggering StandBy while also allowing you to charge two other devices simultaneously via the base.
There’s a fast charger for the Apple Watch that you can either charge flat or flip up and another spot in the back for your
AirPods or another wireless earbuds case. Since it’s Made for iPhone (MFi) certified, it’ll recharge your phone at the fastest
adapters for the US, UK, EU, and AU. It rarely goes on sale, so this is the lowest price we’ve seen yet. —Brenda Stolyar

I always carry two phones on me, one an iPhone and the other an Android. The Android is my work phone, and I don’t need a fancy
camera but I do prize a big battery and fast charging. I have the luxury of working with one of the journalism world’s top experts
on mobile phones, Julian Chokkattu, who had just the right phone to replace my busted Samsung Galaxy. The OnePlus 12R has been
great. The blazing-fast 100W charger, which comes included, does its business in a half hour and the phone will usually last me
two days on a single charge. The curved screen is pleasant and responsive, even if the photos don’t compare to my iPhone 15 Pro
I just reviewed the , but you can get a similar experience with last year’s model without spending $1,000. The exterior screen
isn’t as large as the latest Razr but it’s still roomy, allowing you to look at widgets, play some mini-games, and browse some
apps. Performance is great, it’s super compact when closed, and you can open it up to view a 6.9-inch OLED screen. What’s not to
like? Oh, and you can totally flip it closed to end a call. Nice. —Julian Chokkattu
Samsung’s flagship phone of 2024 remains the best Android phone to buy if you want all the bells and whistles, from a super bright

This year’s Moto G Power 5G () is the best Moto G phone Motorola has made in a long time. It looks and feels luxe, and has all the
bells and whistles you could hope for in a modern-day phone, including wireless charging. The performance is solid, and the
cameras are capable. It’s a no-brainer at this price. The only problem? Motorola promises one OS upgrade and three years of
security updates, so don’t expect many new features after a year. —Julian Chokkattu
A Pixel 9 Fold is expected to arrive in August, which might explain this big price drop. The Pixel Fold () has the older Tensor G2
chipset, but this is still one of my favorite folding phones because it’s quite short and wide, unlike many other booklike folding
devices that opt for a tall and narrow experience. Wider apps are surprisingly nice as you can fit more on the 5.8-inch front
screen, but you can open this handset up and enjoy a full 7.6-inch screen for all your multitasking needs. Just remember that,
unlike newer Pixel phones, the Pixel Fold will only get four more years of security updates (and will only go up to Android 17).
The Edge+ was my favorite , and it’s still a good buy at this price. You get an immersive 6.7-inch OLED display with curved edges,
a 165-Hz screen refresh rate, and the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen-2 chipset of 2023. It has it all, from NFC for tap-to-pay to
wireless charging. The only downside? The camera system is so-so, and this device will only get two more Android OS updates and
The is the slightly cheaper version of last year’s flagship Samsung Galaxy S23 series, with lesser specs all around. It still
makes for a perfectly compelling device with great performance, capable triple cameras, and perks like wireless charging. This is
the lowest price we have tracked yet. It has a pretty good software update policy, too. —Julian Chokkattu
This is one of our favorite cases for the Galaxy S24 series, and it’s available and . It comes in two parts: a hard outer shell
made from 35 percent recycled plastic that goes over a rubber inner cover. It has clicky buttons, good protection around the edges
of the screen, and the port is even covered up (it’s easy to flip open to plug in a USB-C charger). —Julian Chokkattu
The Pixel 8 () will be getting a successor sooner than expected—Google has a hardware announcement planned in August where we are
expected to see the Pixel 9 series. This discount is one we have sparingly seen before during major sale events but is a heck of a
price for a flagship Android phone. The cameras are great, performance is speedy, and it’s packed with Google’s smart features
that are genuinely helpful. My , which vets calls from unknown numbers so you don’t have to ever deal with scams and robocalls.

What we like best about this phone mount is that you can use it one-handed. Simply adjust the bottom feet, place your phone
against the trigger button, and the arms automatically close around the phone. To remove it, press the release bars. Equipped with
a telescopic arm and a ball joint, you can easily adjust the placement and angle of your phone too. The rubber clamp holds your
charging cable in place, so you don’t have to fish around for it. This new version replaces the One Touch 5, which we also love.
iOttie didn’t make a lot of changes to this version, aside from redesigning the cable clamp (it’s magnetic on the 5) and removing
the adjustment knobs—now you can pull it forward to extend the arm and pull the feet down to adjust them. —Brenda Stolyar

I’ve been telling everyone with an Apple Watch that’s older than a Series 5 that they will need to upgrade soon. has a couple of
very exciting (for me) updates, but chief among them is that the OS is only compatible with watches released after the Series 6.
Happily, that includes the second-gen of the Watch SE so if you’re not planning on waiting for the latest, greatest upgrades at
Apple’s hardware event this fall, this is your best chance to pick one up that will have the new Vitals and Training Load apps.
The first big caveat here is that yes, Apple is no longer selling watches with the blood oxygen sensor enabled via because of a
patent dispute. The good news is that third-party sellers like Amazon aren’t subject to the ban, so you can still pick it up. The
is still very good. I am particularly excited by the . For the first time, Apple Watch users are going to be able to view their
health metrics at a glance in the Vitals app and gauge their performance improvements with a new algorithm called Training Load.
Slowly but surely, Apple’s fitness software is catching up to Garmin’s—if you have an iPhone. —Adrienne So
The Ultra 2 () is our favorite Apple Watch for outdoor sports. You'll have access to onboard precision dual-frequency GPS, offline
maps (as long as you have them downloaded to your iPhone and keep it within Bluetooth range of the watch), and the ability to see
your cycling session as a Live Activity on your iPhone's screen. With the built-in Action button, you can also use the Backtrack
feature which creates virtual breadcrumb trails via the Compass app for when you're on your way back home. Under the hood is both
an S9 chip that delivers fast performance and an ultra-wideband chip for enhanced precision finding features (to help you locate
your iPhone when it's lost somewhere around the house). You'll also have access to Double Tap, which triggers functions like
hanging up a call or dismissing an alarm by tapping your index finger and thumb. —Brenda Stolyar
In a world awash with ever more technical fitness trackers collecting ever more esoteric data, I am grateful for the stripped down
simplicity and affordable price of a Fitbit. Late last year, we finally saw the company start to integrate more Google features
into its line of flagship . On the Charge 6 (), you can get directions via Google Maps, music controls with YouTube Music Premium,
and contactless pay with Google Wallet. The app redesign is lovely and no longer looks like it’s from 1996. And of course, you get
Fitbit’s full suite of health sensors and algorithmic expertise, although for the full benefit you do have to pay extra for a
Fitbit Premium subscription for more in-depth features. I have a caveat here that there’s no fall detection and sometimes
connectivity was an issue. Still, in a time where every fitness tracker seems to be adding on increasingly outlandish health
metrics, the Charge 6 is refreshingly simple, useful, and under $150. —Adrienne So
Did you want but you have an Android phone, or simply not enough room in the budget? Then the Sense 2 is for you. Like the Apple
Watch, it has skin temperature sensing, blood oxygen sensing, and an ECG sensor to note signs of atrial fibrillation. It also has
a stress response score, taking into account electrodermal activity and changes in your heart rate to tell you when you need to
take a chill pill and slow down (although I found the stress response test to be when I tested it). As always, you do need to have
a subscription to access some of the best health features, like sleep tracking. I also have to mention that if you really do want
an Apple Watch, the Apple Watch SE frequently dips on sale for below $200. However, buying an iPhone is a much higher barrier to
entry than a smaller monthly subscription, so if you wanted a more high-powered fitness tracker, this might be a good bet for you.
Bar none, the Pixel Watch is the and on the market right now. The first iteration was missing a lot of features, but the latest
one now has everything we wanted when it first came on the market, along with a faster processor and Wear 4, the latest version of
Google’s wearable OS. It pairs with Fitbit and that company’s lovely app redesign and it has all of Fitbit’s health features,
including a new feature called Body Response, which warns you when you’re stressed (like, you know, in the middle of Prime Day).
It’s so pretty that it almost makes you overlook the annoying proprietary charger and so-so battery life (you have to charge it
We can go on about specs all day, but when it comes down to it, a watch is an object that you have on your body all day, every
day. You should like how it looks and feels. That’s why reviewer Julian Chokkattu likes the Galaxy Watch6 (). Unlike that have you
poking and tapping at a screen, it has Samsung’s famous mechanical rotating bezel that you can click and turn! Other than that,
this is a pretty standard smartwatch with two-day battery life and the usual set of health and fitness features. Some apps only
work with Samsung phones, so this is our best pick if you own one. —Adrienne So
We rarely see discounts on Oura’s biohacking smart rings, but the Oura Ring Gen3 Horizon () is currently on sale for Prime Day.
This smart ring is stylish, tracks your activity, and is currently . It packs three hospital-grade sensors: infrared
photoplethysmography sensors for heart rate and respiration, a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) sensor for body temperature,
and a 3D accelerometer for movement. The app is easy to use, but you do have to factor in the cost of Oura’s $6-per-month
membership, which is essential to get the most from this gadget. I love my Oura Ring, but I would caution you against the black
finish, as mine has started to lose its coating in spots (silver is best). —Simon Hill
If you fancy a smart ring to track your activity and sleep but balk at the sight of a subscription, the Ultrahuman Ring Air ()
could be just what you need. It is lightweight and comfortable, offers solid and useful health tips, and doesn’t require a

TCL’s QM8 series has been among the best mid-tier TVs you can buy for years now. When Parker Hall reviewed last year’s QM8 (), he
lauded the 75-inch model as a brighter and cheaper alternative to a projector. In my own review, I praised the TV for its mix of
fabulous brightness, rich colors, and the striking contrast of its mini LED, among plenty of great features. We haven’t yet
reviewed the 2024 version, the QM851G, as it’s relatively new. What we know so far is TCL has gone a little bonkers, claiming the
new screen provides double the peak brightness of last year’s model to create the brightest mini-LED TV on the market, besting
even the ultra-bright . The latest QM8 keeps all the other features we liked, including a mini-LED panel, a Google TV interface,
solid gaming features with HDMI 2.1 support, and much more. This TV stands to be one of the best mid-tier TVs you can buy this
year and an outstanding mercenary of brightness to battle even the most challenging lighting conditions. —Ryan Waniata
Roku’s first TV, the , was an impressive entry for the brand best known for making our favorite streaming software. With the Pro
Series, Roku proves it can hold its own against some of the best mid-tier TV brands (namely Hisense and TCL). The Pro Series has a
few flaws, including minor struggles with motion handling and, like virtually all LED TVs in its class, poor side-view
performance. On the bright side, its mini LED screen provides deep black levels, powerful brightness, and quantum dots for vibrant
colors. Unlike the Plus Series, it’s got a 120Hz refresh rate and features like VRR for smooth gaming at high frame rates. As well
as it performs, the Pro Series’ biggest strength is usability, from its intuitive Roku OS smart interface to features like a
button on the side that produces a chime from its remote when you lose it. I just love using this TV, and when you pair that with
its standup picture performance, you get serious value—especially at its sale price of around $1,000. —Ryan Waniata
The trait I like best about the Roku Plus Series TV is right in the title—Roku’s simple and convenient operating system runs the
show. That makes this affordable QLED TV one of the best options for TV novices who just want a friendly and accommodating setup.
The TV has more up its sleeve, of course, including solid brightness contrasted by good black levels and vibrant quantum dot
colors. Its so-so motion handling and 60Hz panel (rather than the 120Hz panel of some rivals) means it's not the best for sports
or gaming, but it throws in usability features like available hands-free search and a remote finder that assures you’ll never
again lose the little bugger in your couch cushions. The Plus Series’ blend of solid features, performance, and design mixed with
Roku’s oh-so-easy interface make for a welcome entry into the flashy world of 4K HDR—especially at this price. —Ryan Waniata
LG’s C-series OLED TVs are perennial stunners, offering tons of flagship features and premium picture quality at a price that sits
a tier below the top 4K TVs of the season. The C3 () was one of the best TVs we reviewed last year, offering impressive
brightness, sweet and accurate colors, crystal clear detail, and generally fantastic performance across the board. It’s flush with
four HDMI 2.1 ports to get the most from modern gaming consoles and PCs, a snappy (if somewhat clunky) webOS interface, and a
refined design that looks gorgeous on your console. There’s a reason this TV is a surefire top choice for everything from movies
to gaming, and with the modestly updated C4 now on shelves, it’s a great time for savvy shoppers to grab the previous model. —Ryan
LG’s Gallery edition TVs have always been the cream of its OLED crop, but the G3 stands out as one of the best and brightest OLEDs
ever made, a major evolution from the previous year’s G2. Utilizing LG’s evo panel with technology enhancements like MLA
near-infinite contrast, a wide viewing angle, and brilliantly accurate yet vibrant colors. The stunning picture is just part of
the story, as the G3 provides a stylish panel designed to be flush mounted to your wall, four HDMI 2.1 inputs for 4K resolution at
LG’s lightning-fast A9 Gen-6 processor. While the newer G4 offers modest upgrades, this is a fabulous flagship display that’s
dropped to $1,000 below original price even before this sale. Not bad for one of the very best TVs you can buy. —Ryan Waniata
Samsung’s Frame TV has won the hearts of buyers for years now thanks to its distinctive aesthetic, which frames the TV panel like
a painting to blend in with your decor. The latest model offers a matte, anti-glare screen like the new Samsung S95D (), which
provides a slick aesthetic that looks more like the canvas of a painting than a traditional glossy screen. The anti-glare tech
also dissipates in-room reflections more than regular screens. Behind the Frame’s matte screen is a 4K HDR QLED display, which
uses quantum dots for bright and vivid colors. Add in features like a customizable picture border, background art displays at
rest, and a sensor to turn the TV on or off when you enter or leave a room and you’ve got a work of art that’s also a solid 4K TV.
After a decade away, Samsung jumped back into OLED TVs to near-universal praise with its S95 series. The second-edition S95C ()
brings a potent mix of quantum dot colors, improved brightness, and all the best OLED traits like perfect black levels and a wide
viewing angle. It all adds up to a picture that’s among the most stunning you can buy. Like all Samsung TVs, the S95C lacks Dolby
Vision support and uses Samsung’s cluttered Tizen interface, but it heaps in plenty of other topline features. You’ll get a fully
loaded inputs section, a fabulous gaming hub, and support for gaming extras like VRR for silky motion. Samsung’s latest S95D ()
has higher brightness, but its new anti-reflective screen has pros and cons depending on your room. Especially given its sinking
price, 2023’s S95C is one of the you can buy right now, full stop. —Ryan Waniata
Samsung’s 8K TVs generally start at an insane novelty price and move their way down to pricey but approachable. This 75-inch model
is well worth considering at its lowest price of the year for anyone even casually interested in an 8K panel. There isn’t much 8K
content out there, but the QN900C does a fabulous job upscaling 4K content, which looks particularly good at screen sizes of 75
inches or higher. You’ll get exquisite clarity and refined detail, great black levels and contrast, fantastic brightness,
eye-popping quantum dot colors, and just about everything else that makes a flagship display sing. The QN900C also adds goodies
like flawless high-frame-rate gaming and the one-connect box for adaptable setup. Its stylish screen is good at handling
reflections and off-angle viewing, though it can create a rainbow effect with overhead lights. Like all Samsung TVs, it doesn’t
support Dolby Vision and I think its Tizen interface is just OK outside of its excellent Gaming Hub. Otherwise, this is a premium
screen top to bottom, and the best way I know to jump into 8K. —Ryan Waniata
Hisense’s U8N () is a brightness ambassador, offering the highest peak brightness of any TV we’ve tested. While that takes some
getting used to when it comes to adjusting the picture, its optical sensor helps to adjust for darker or lighter environments, and
all that power helps the TV excel in rooms with tons of ambient light. That’s just part of the appeal, as the TV continues its
reign as one of the best performers in its class, with deep black levels for excellent contrast, rich and vibrant quantum dot
colors, and a 120Hz mini LED panel that provides topline gaming features for versatile performance. You’ll also get a simple
Google TV interface and plenty of other great features. As a mid-tier LED TV, the U8N has a few minor struggles, such as mediocre
motion handling and off-angle viewing, but overall this is a very nice package that packs in fantastic value. That’s especially
true now that it’s at its lowest price of the year. —Ryan Waniata
I’ve only spent a few days with the U7N so far, but this follow up to last year’s excellent U7K has already impressed. Its mini
LED panel provides flashy brightness balanced by excellent contrast and black levels, helping the TV exceed expectations for its
price class. It adds expansive quantum dot colors, solid gaming features alongside a high-refresh 120Hz panel, and plenty of other
extras you wouldn’t expect to land for well under $1,000. That is, you wouldn’t expect it from brands other than Hisense, and a
few of its mid-tier competitors like TCL and Roku. This is simply a solid value, now at its lowest price of the year so far.
The Roku Streaming Stick 4K is the for most people. There are fancier devices with more features, but are generally the simplest
to set up and navigate. A no-frills home screen shows you all your apps without extra clutter so you can do what you came there to
This particular Roku bundle is an Amazon exclusive. Unlike the Streaming Stick 4K, the Express 4K doesn’t support Dolby Vision or
have long-range Wi-Fi (you likely won’t notice much of a connection difference anyway), but it has a better remote. The Voice
Remote Pro lets you ask Roku to do things, like pull up Netflix, without having to actually touch a button. That also means that
if you lose it in the couch cushions, you just have to ask Roku where it is for it to play a sound. This has come in handy more
With a 240-hz refresh rate and 4K resolution, this is an excellent projector for folks who like to game or watch sports at an up
to 300-inch scale. It’s HDR10 compatible for great color, and a 15,000-hour lamp life on the DLP bulb means it will last you years

Acer's Chromebook Plus 514 () is one of our favorites out of the recent crop of new, more powerful Chromebooks. It's everything
you need for everyday tasks like browsing the web, editing documents, and chatting with friends. The Keyboard and trackpad are
excellent, which is unusual for a Chromebook and the touch display feels great. It's not going to win any design awards, and
there's no backlit keyboard, but this is a lot of laptop for the price.
Acer's laptop names get confusing. The model number here is the A315-24PT-R0UX, which is no less confusing, but can at least be
used to compare to other models. This is an upgrade to . It offers the best value, with an AMD Ryzen 5 7520U processor, 16 GB of
RAM, and 512-GB NVMe SSD. It's big, and the display is not the sharpest, but it won't strain your eyes. Interestingly, the title
here says 16 GB RAM, as does one of the spec listings, but another says 8 GB of RAM, and it's Amazon, so who knows what you're
going to get. If you end up with 8 GB, return it.
I still think Samsung’s high-end Android tablets are overpriced—but I also think the same about Apple’s top-end iPad Pro models.
If you’ve been eyeing a high-powered flagship Android tablet with a beautiful OLED screen, high refresh rate, powerful
performance, and an included stylus, then you know you want the Galaxy Tab S9 series. These slates from 2023 are still the most
luxe Android tablets you can buy and it’s unlikely that Samsung will have a successor in 2024. The Tab S9+ specifically is the
middle option in the lineup and packs a large 12.9-inch screen, but you can opt for the equally great smaller Tab S9, which is .
OnePlus’ first tablet () is currently our favorite , though the company is actually announcing today. Probably explains this deal,
though it's not the lowest price we've ever tracked. It remains an excellent slate, with a sharp 11.6-inch LCD display and a
check to see if the company is bundling the keyboard or stylus for free. The keyboard is a very nice addition if you plan on doing
The Fire HD 10 remains . The 1080p screen is much better for watching videos, and the 3 GB of RAM helps in browsing the web with
many tabs. There are 32-GB or 64-GB models, with a microSD slot on both so you can add up to 1 TB of storage if you need more
space. Whichever you choose, Amazon will serve up advertisements on the lock screen. To get rid of that, you’ll need to spend $15
more for the version without “special offers,” something we highly recommend.
The Fire Max 11 () is the company’s attempt to make Fire tablets go to 11. From this effort I learned that, . One big problem is
the price, which this deal eliminates. At $140 the Fire Max 11 is worth considering, though it is still hamstrung by the same Fire
OS that powers the cheaper models. Still, f all you plan to do is consume Amazon content, and the price doesn’t bother you, the
Fire Max 11 is a good way to do it. The screen is bright and sharp enough, the speakers aren’t bad, and the cameras are 1080p and
nicer than the cameras on the rest of the Fire tablets. —Scott Gilbertson
Amazon’s Fire HD 8 () hasn’t been updated since 2022. It’s fast enough for most things you’ll do on a Fire tablet, which is why
it’s , but the screen isn’t nearly as nice as the Fire 10 HD screen. On this smaller model, pixels are often still visible and
movies often feel flat. Still, the HD 8 has most of the benefits of the HD 10, including hands-free Alexa, stereo sound, USB-C,
Western Digital's SN770 is our top pick for most people. It achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If
you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version
you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. I've been using it as my main drive for several
months and found it fast enough for everything I do, including editing 5.2K video footage and compiling software. My favorite
One of our , the SN850X is awesomely fast. Western Digital claims up to 7,300 Mbps read speeds, and in benchmark tests, this
drive's results came close. To take full advantage of the speed here, you'll need a system that supports the PCIe 4.0 SSD
standard, but this is a great drive if you want to upgrade a gaming system, whether it's a desktop PC or your PlayStation. —Scott
This is our for phones, with storage that tops out at 256 gigabytes. It has both a Lightning plug for and and a USB-C plug for and
iPad, you’ll have to install the . It’s not the fastest drive (90 MB/s read, 35 MB/s write) but it works well—it took a couple of
hours to back up photos from an iPhone. In terms of design, it’s slim and the metal casing has a loop for a keychain. But one plug
is always exposed, so SanDisk provides a separate plastic cover that slots on—you’ll have to be careful not to lose it. —Brenda
You probably know what a microSD card is. These itty-bitty thumbnail-sized cards can help you greatly expand the storage space of
your , , or (as just a few examples). SanDisk microSD cards are popular for good reason. They’re fast and they’re reliable, and
they tend to be affordable. The price of this card fluctuates wildly, but anything under $20 is a good deal. It comes with an
adapter so you can transfer files to and from your computer. —Louryn Strampe

If you have a smaller room but are looking for immersive audio to pair with your fancy late-generation TV, this is a very solid
choice () that ranks among . It has clean looks, dedicated rear speakers, and a subwoofer, and the ability to fire sound off your
ceiling for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X effects like helicopters flying above you in action movies. We see deals on this model all the
time, but $400 is about as low as it ever goes, which makes now a good time to buy. —Parker Hall
Vizio’s Elevate () is designed to bring a bit of visual excitement to an otherwise boring product category, using a pair of
turning drivers on the outside of the bar to aim sound either at your ears or the ceiling, depending on what you’re watching. Play
music or other non-Dolby Atmos audio and the two side drivers on the bar aim at your ears, but they turn skyward when you play any
content with immersive audio, creating a height channel. It also comes with wireless surround speakers and a subwoofer, for a more
When I started testing Bose’s pint-sized , I was instantly impressed by the sheer musicality and immersion it creates from such a
small frame. Bose’s blend of advanced signal processing and well-placed acoustics, including dedicated upfiring drivers, creates
engaging sound for everything from Dolby Atmos movies to sitcoms or your favorite Spotify Playlist. The one missing element is
lower bass, which can take some of the punch out of action flicks, but Bose does sell an should you want to supplement the
soundbar later. As with Sonos’s Beam, the 600 offers streaming over Wi-Fi, a built-in microphone for Amazon Alexa voice commands,
and the ability to connect with other Bose speakers in a multiroom audio setup. Unlike the Beam, it also includes Bluetooth as a
backup to Wi-Fi streaming and a dedicated remote. It all adds up to a loaded smart bar that sounds a lot better than you’d expect.
Sonos’ cute little Ray soundbar is unlike just about anything else out there. Offering a profile akin to a large Bluetooth
speaker, it puts out clear, smooth, and surprisingly premium sound for its size. Unlike most soundbars these days, it connects to
your TV via optical input instead of HDMI ARC and it doesn’t come with its own remote, so you’ll have to use the remote program
function or the Sonos app to control it. On the positive side, it’s the only bar I’ve tested at this price that offers Wi-Fi
connectivity, able to sync up with other Sonos speakers in a multi-room or surround sound configuration and source audio from
multiple streaming services as well as AirPlay 2 and Spotifiy Connect. The Ray won’t be for everyone, but if you’re after a
talented Wi-Fi bar with Sonos chops and great sound, it’s a killer deal on sale. —Ryan Waniata
If you want proper home theater bass, you’re gonna want a subwoofer. I like this 2.1 bar from Polk () for smaller living rooms
where you still want cinematic low end. It isn’t as immersive as the more expensive Sony bar above, but it still scratches the
Dolby Atmos itch too, bouncing sound off the walls to surround you as best it can. —Parker Hall
All-in-one soundbars tend to barely be better than the crappy built-in speakers on your flatscreen, which is why with this bar
from Sony. Not only does it feature built-in drivers that are dedicated to low end (they call it a built-in subwoofer), but this
model can shoot sound off your walls and ceiling to simulate Dolby Atmos object-based audio. Sony’s audio and video processing is
legendary and leads to this smallish bar sounding massive, especially in medium-to-small rooms like apartment living rooms or
Depending on your desk setup a soundbar underneath your monitor might be a better fit than speakers and this one won a place in
our guide. You will love or hate the flashy RGB lighting and the sight of the passive radiators on top bouncing up and down when
the bass kicks in. It is Dolby Atmos-certified with gaming modes for spatial sound, and surround sound for movies. You also get

Sony has made some of the for a decade at this point, and the latest model continues the tradition with excellent sound and insane
levels of silence. I like their clean, businesslike looks, which don’t draw attention to the luxurious listening experience you
get underneath. They have a solid app, and support features like putting one hand over an ear to pause music for a second, which
is nice for announcements on planes and in airports. Touch controls make changing volumes and songs a breeze, and the included
case is great for tucking in backpacks or larger purses. They’re still electronics, but I also like that they come in eco-friendly
The Space A40 () are some of the very you can buy for the money. They offer noise canceling powerful enough to quiet buzzing HVACs
and turn bustling streets into a tranquil whoosh. Their sound is clear and accessible, with excellent delineation of instruments.
They’re comfy and offer plenty of features in the Soundcore app, and they look and feel more like a flagship model than budget
buds. You can certainly get better noise canceling and more precise touch controls by spending up, and the buds skip auto-pause
sensors. Those are mere nitpicks considering the price, though. If you’re looking to spend well under $100, good luck doing better
The Beats Solo 4 (), an update of 2016’s Solo 3, were a long time coming. For all the waiting, Beats kept the features quite
minimal, without adding upgrades like noise canceling and transparency mode. The Solo 4 headphones aren’t bereft of modern extras,
though, with features like one-touch pairing and Find My support for both iPhone and Android devices, as well as spatial audio
support and Hands-Free Siri support for iPhone. The Solo 4’s sound is what really impressed me, with clear detail and a buttery
touch to the bass and lower midrange that combines for a fun and vibrant performance. For Beats fans after a deal who don’t mind
sacrificing noise canceling, the Solo 4 could be worth grabbing above cheaper offerings, especially at a price that falls well
When I reviewed the Studio Pros (), I called them good not great, which is true at their full $350 price. At $250 or lower, the
Studio Pros rise above that status, especially if you like their style and sound, which are equally vibrant, colorful, and fun.
Their zippy treble and firm but balanced bass help them stand out in a crowded market. They skip extras like auto-pause sensors,
something the majority of headphones in their class offer, but they also bring some Apple exclusives like support for “Hey Siri”
and Find My support. They pair those with Android extras like Google Fast Pair and Find My Device, playing both sides of the
aisle. I was also impressed by the Studio Pros’ natural-sounding transparency mode, which pairs with their solid noise canceling
for a pretty clutch package. Greatness is subjective, but at this price, I’d say the Studio Pros easily qualify. –Ryan Waniata
The 2021 Echo Buds () might be the older version, but they’re still our favorite Echo Buds to buy. The second-generation model has
wireless charging, active noise canceling, good overall sound with 5.7-mm drivers, and a great app experience, too. It’s easy to
summon Alexa for various commands like setting timers and checking your calendar, similar to how you’d use . It’s one of the best
experiences you can get for the price, and that’s before it was on sale. These headphones often drop to around $45, so seeing them
Jabra’s Elite 4 Active still rank among my favorite affordable sports buds two years on, and what’s not to love? They’ve got a
comfy and durable build, good sound, lots of customization features in the Jabra Sound+ app, and even some modest noise canceling.
The fit is stable and comfy, allowing me to wear them all day for all sorts of activities. I love the accessible push-button
controls, and the design is dust- and water-resistant, meaning you can use them for all your sporty adventures and even rinse them
off when you’re done. Jabra has thrown in the towel on consumer earbuds, but the company promises to support all its earbuds at
least through their ample two-year warranty. If you’re after affordable workout buds that stay put and work great, the Elite 4
Active are a great buy on sale or otherwise. Note: Deals fluctuate in price depending on the color. —Ryan Waniata
Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones () are the ultimate in noise cancellation, offering spooky silence across frequencies. While
no headphones can cancel everything, these get as close as we’ve heard, strangling sounds like HVACs and passing cars into near
oblivion, and even shutting down louder annoyances like washing machines and barking dogs—especially with a bit of music playing.
Speaking of music, they offer clear and spunky sound marked by excellent instrumental definition and good balance. They also
support top features like multipoint pairing and spatial audio for stereo tracks with head tracking designed to anchor you in the
center of the sound. While they’re tough to afford at full price, at well below $400 they’re solid value in this pricey space.
Sony’s Linkbuds S are an odd follow-up to the original Linkbuds () in that, besides the fact that they’re both small Sony earbuds,
they share very little in common. Unlike the original Linkbuds, the “S” model has no hole through the middle to let in the outside
world. Instead, they’re designed like traditional wireless earbuds, offering features like noise canceling and transparency mode
to block out or let in the world around you, respectively. Their biggest asset is their small size, which makes them brilliantly
light and comfy. They also bring lots of customization options like a multi-band EQ, speak-to-chat (which pauses the buds when you
talk), and Adaptive Sound Control to adjust to your environment. They top things off with clear and zippy sound, though it does
lean toward the brighter side. The Linkbuds S were too pricey at $200, but at $130 or so they’re a good deal for Sony buds with a
Bose’s former flagship QC 45 headphones are reborn in the simplified “QuietComfort” headphones, bringing it all back around again.
Confusing names aside, what you need to know here is that these headphones are much more utilitarian than the fancier noise
canceling kings I reviewed earlier this year, the QuietComfort Ultra. The baseline Quietcomfort use more push-button controls and
have a more sculpted sound. What hasn’t changed is they still offer excellent noise canceling that’s among the best in their price
class, especially if you nab them at this great sale price. At $200, you’ll have a very hard time finding better noise cancelers
These Sennheisers are our . Wired in-ear headphones are a great way to take top-tier audio quality with you anywhere for use with
any device (provided it has a headphone jack). The Sennheisers are ergonomic and wrap comfortably around your ear for a secure fit
and a good seal. The quality dynamic drivers mean you'll hear all of your music and virtually none of the world around you. If you
want wired headphone audio quality but want something compact you can travel with, these are a great option, especially at this
Sennheiser’s Momentum 4 headphones aren’t the best noise cancelers and they don’t offer the most features. What they do offer is,
perhaps unsurprising to the Sennheiser faithful, the best sound of anything I’ve tested in their class. You’ll get clear,
unwavering definition and instrumental placement spread across a rich and engaging soundstage. Everything sounds better with the
Momentum 4, and you’ll likely discover new details about songs you’ve heard dozens of times. They don’t stop there, offering
respectable noise canceling, handy features like multipoint pairing to connect to two devices at once, and knockout battery life
of up to 60 hours per charge. You can futz with the settings in the Sennheiser app, including messing with the EQ (not that you’ll
need to). If you’re after great travel headphones that sound a notch above the rest, the Momentum 4 are the pair to grab. —Ryan
Sony's noise-canceling buds ) won't get you quite the same isolation as over-ear noise-canceling headphones, but they're much
easier to travel with. The relatively compact buds come with excellent adaptive canceling and great microphones for calls, plus
extra features like the ability to sense when you are talking and pause the music, which is great for folks who hate constantly
taking in and out one earbud for quick chats. These work great for workouts, with the included memory foam ear tips keeping them
Denon’s PerL earbuds () have a neat trick that maps your hearing like an ear doctor and adjusts the sound accordingly. There are
lots of earbuds that offer some version of this, but Denon’s comes from a company called that has been evolving its customization
technique for years. The result is impressively clear and detailed sound tailored just for you, though you may have to do a few
rounds of tests before you get it dialed in just right. The earbuds are bulky and can wear on your ears after a few hours, but the
fit is stable and features like noise canceling, a volume limiter, and adjustable auto-pause make them worth considering,
These noise-canceling earbuds from lesser-known brand Raycon () surprised me with their quality build and great features. They
rival much more expensive buds on sound, and I liked them enough to give them an excellent review at full price. At the $50 mark,
as long as you're in need of a pair of great cheap buds, these are a no-brainer. —Parker Hall
Jabra’s Elite 8 Active earbuds have a lot of good stuff, from clear and balanced sound to solid noise canceling, but their best
asset is their design. With an rating, they’re both dust- and waterproof, able to accompany you from the trail to the pool. Their
ergonomic fit makes them stable and comfy for hours of wear, without the need for fins or hooks to keep them in place during your
toughest workouts. All of this has made them our perennial top pick as the . Jabra has a new Elite 8 version, which basically just
upgrades the case with a wireless transmitter that can plug into 3.5-mm devices. The company is calling it quits on consumer
earbuds after this latest pair, but promises to back their products through their two-year warranties at least. As such, the older
Elite 8s are still a good buy, especially at their enticing sale price. —Ryan Waniata
Brands like Sony, Bose, and Apple get all the love when it comes to high-quality earbuds, but don’t sleep on Technics. The
Panasonic-owned hi-fi brand has been making loaded earbuds with excellent sound for a few generations now. I was a big fan of the
original EAH-AZ60 earbuds for their great balance of performance, features, and overall polish and the 2nd-Gen is even better.
You’ll get mid-tier noise canceling, clear and detailed sound (including Sony’s LDAC tech for high-resolution streaming), and
multipoint pairing that lets you seamlessly switch between not two but up to three different devices. They’re also quite stylish
with a metallic finish that harks back to Technics turntables and amplifiers. At this price, you’re getting a sweet deal on some
Click on the coupon to see the full discount at checkout. SoundPeats is an up-and-coming budget audio brand that has consistently
surprised me with sound quality that punches above its price class. The Air4 Pro () earbuds are another fine option, offering
clear and balanced sound with warm and smooth bass alongside impressive features for a budget set. You’ll get mid-tier noise
canceling, good battery life, auto-pause sensors, and even seamless multipoint connection for jumping between devices. That’s a
lot of good stuff for buds priced well below $100. At a sale price of around $60, the Air4 Pro buds rise from a good option to
stand among the most value-packed buds you can buy. —Ryan Waniata
Jabra for what it thinks will be greener pastures, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t made some of the best earbuds around for over a
decade. These are great workout buds that I find super comfortable, and they have active noise canceling that rivals more
expensive options like the AirPods Pro. Six onboard microphones make calls excellent, and you’ll get over six hours of battery
life (what AirPods Pro get) with noise canceling on. —Parker Hall
If you want to pick just how much of the outside world pipes through to you during your running or cycling playlist for safety
reasons, the JBL Reflect Aero are a solid choice that rank among our . You can use the JBL Headphones app to choose how much noise

Battery lasts eight hours, which drops to six with adaptive noise canceling engaged; you’ll have more than enough time for
JLab’s Go Air Pop buds are an exercise in sheer technological concision. There’s nothing fancy or superfluous here, just solid
earbuds that work well for less money than you might spend on a Tuesday night happy hour. You’ll get up to eight hours of battery
per charge, simple touch controls, a charging case with multiple recharges, and even a few EQ presets to adjust the sound. The
audio performance is understandably basic, but it’s easygoing and unobjectionable for music and podcasts. Add in fun colors and
moderate water resistance and you’ve got a guilt-free purchase that’s perfect for those who just want some cheap wireless earbuds
that get the job done. These are already at their regular $25 price, and their latest discount makes them even harder to pass up.
After a decade-plus as an A/V reviewer, I’ve heard way more than my fair share of mindblowing audiophile earbuds. While there have
been plenty of highs, only a few leave a lasting imprint like Shure’s fabulous KSE1500. These specialized, electrostat buds aren’t
for the timid, requiring a big investment and a specialized headphone amplifier/DAC (included), but when you hear them you’ll know
sheer sonic bliss. Their sound is astonishingly clear, with instruments seemingly spread across a broad soundstage like radiant
pillars. Every breath, string slide, or stick click is there, laid out in effortless detail. Maybe most remarkable is the
KSE1500’s warm and rich tone coloration, which makes their brilliant definition all the more engaging. You don’t have to spend
this much on earbuds to get amazing sound, but if you want true, ultra-portable hi-fi, the KSE1500 bring it, now with a very
Sony’s Ult Wear headphones bring the bass, and lots of it. Like, an insane amount of bass, especially if you dare to go full-blast
with the left ear cup’s sidecar bass button. It’s more powerful than I care to explore, but if you’re a bass addict it could be a
fun ride. Without the bass button engaged, the sound is expansive and accessible, if rather flat and murky in the midrange and
treble. The Ult Wear have some solid extras for their price class, including mid-level noise canceling that turns fans and HVAC
drone sounds to mere whispers, touch controls for easy navigation, and extras like multipoint pairing. Not bad for a pair of Sony
cans priced well under $200 on sale. The build leans more toward bargain bin than premium digs, and the sound quality doesn’t
match up with siblings like the WH-1000XM4, but if you’re looking for bounteous bass in a laidback pair of noise cancelers, the
Whether you are jogging, cycling, working out, or running errands, headphones that stay in place and can withstand some sweat are
a necessity. These open-ear headphones can clip onto a titanium memory wire to fit securely around the back of your neck. They can
go for 14 hours with an additional 40 or so from the charging case. WIRED editor Adrienne So said they are the comfiest she has
tested, and they appear in our guide. They have been on sale before, but this is the first time we have seen a discount this deep.
The feature-packed Liberty 4 NC wireless earbuds () boast excellent noise canceling for the money. Reviewer Ryan Waniata said they
combine clear and relatively detailed sound with flashy looks. He also found them light and comfortable to wear with plenty of
customization options, though he found the touch controls finicky. We have seen them at this price before (last year), but they
With solid hybrid active noise-canceling, excellent 40-hour playtime, and pretty good sound quality for the money, there are our
favorite noise-canceling . They have 40-mm silk diaphragm drivers inside and work well as a travel companion. Just be careful of
the fragile plastic headband. While these headphones are frequently discounted to this price, we have never seen them cheaper.
It is hard to snag a decent pair of , let alone $50, which is why I love this classic-looking pair from Audio-Technica. They punch
way above their weight on sound, with excellent large drivers that deliver full, warm bass, and decent balance throughout the mids
and treble. The downside is that they’re a bit plasticky, so you just want to be careful when you take them with you. —Parker Hall
If you think most earbuds just aren’t small enough, then you need the JLab Audio JBuds Min. They’re our pick for folks with
smaller ears, but we’ve also . The earbuds are barely the size of a pinkie finger tip, and the case that holds them is only a
little bigger than a quarter (and half the size of an AirPods Pro case!) Not only are these headphones cute and tiny, they also
come in a handful of fun colors that are all on sale for 30% off.
If you’re looking for a more comfortable version of AirPods but refuse to settle for a non-Apple product, the Beats Fit Pro () are
some of the best earbuds around. They have the same noise-canceling (and largely the same sensors and processing) as Apple’s buds,
but they’re much more comfortable. In my opinion, these are cheaper and better than AirPods Pro. —Parker Hall

After years of the Sonos One ruling the smart home roost, Sonos totally re-engineered its pint-sized smart speaker in the Era 100
way, but it also delivers big time on performance with rich and elegant sound and more potent bass than you’d expect. It’s got
powerful microphones to field your smart commands even with music blaring, it’s responsive for playback control with Alexa or
Sonos’ own built-in voice assistant, and it can join with other Sonos speakers and soundbars in a multi-room or surround sound
setup. There’s no support for Google Assistant at present, marking one of the few downsides. Otherwise, this is a perfect addition
Sony’s little can-shaped speaker sounds way better than it has a right to for its size, especially if you give it a solid base on
which to pump its tunes. When sitting properly on a good table or countertop, the XB100 () blasts clear and pleasant audio with
impressive bass for a speaker you can easily fit in a purse, pack, or coat pocket. It’s also pretty loaded on the feature side,
with up to 16 hours of battery, Google Fast Pair, and easy access controls. It comes in a variety of fun colors, perfect for
summer, and its dust- and water-resistance rating means it can hang at a sandy beach or even survive a quick dunk in the pool.
This speaker has become my go-to option when traveling light, livening up my hotel or Airbnb with solid sound. I loved it at full
price. On a good sale, it’s a no-brainer. —Ryan Waniata
This isn’t the latest or greatest Ultimate Ears speaker, but it still is a well-designed option that is waterproof, has excellent
bass, and has speakers on both sides for 360-degree sound (). Twenty hours of battery life and big volume and pairing buttons make
this easy to use, and it even floats if you toss it in the water at the beach. —Parker Hall
This speaker only gets an honorable mention in our guide because it carries a high price tag. This Prime Day mitigates that issue
with a hefty discount. The second generation of the Soundlink Revolve+ has some of the best room (or yard)-filling sound I’ve
tested in any speaker, thanks to its lanternlike shape. Speakers all around shoot sound in 360 degrees, which makes this a great
thing to set on a table next to the hors d'oeuvres. —Parker Hall
This follow-up from the popular Motion Boom speaker provides big and punchy sound, an easy grip handle for portability, and
dunkable water resistance–it even floats so you can take it on all your watersport adventures. The customizable LEDs on the Boom
pumping as long as the party lasts. The speaker’s exterior has a budget feel to it, and the treble can get a little tinny, but its
powerplant of 80 watts of amplification and three separate speakers, including a 50-watt racetrack woofer, make for a powerful
JBL’s Authentics 200 smart speaker () is fluent in both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, allowing you to use either assistant or
both concurrently to do a variety of tasks. This makes it perfect for those with multiple smart products around the house. Its
retro design stands out for its tactile knobs and foam grille, but its excellent sound quality is our favorite trait. After
testing the 200 against competitors for several days, we were pleased to find it wedged between the fantastic Sonos Era 100 and
the powerful Era 300, two of the best-sounding smart speakers on the market. That makes this JBL model something of a ringer, and
a great value on sale for those after a stylish and versatile smart speaker that sounds as good as it looks. —Ryan Waniata
You don’t have to spend a fortune for a decent set of computer speakers. With LED lighting on the back (12 effects) and a compact
form that makes them easy to fit on a crowded desk, these are good for the money. Bass can cause distortion and they get muddy on
the high end, but connectivity options are solid, with USB, aux-in, and Bluetooth 4.2 (there’s even a subwoofer output). As the
under $100 pick in our guide, these Edifier speakers are already quite cheap, and this is the deepest discount we have ever seen
Bose’s Soundlink Flex is like the posh cousin you never had, offering sleek looks and understated style matched by clear and
calculated sound. The speaker comes with all the accouterments you’d expect from a modern portable, including a handy carrying
handle, built-in microphone for taking calls, and a stout frame with IP67 protection from dust and even a dunk in shallow water.
You’ll also get 12 hours of battery life per charge and compatibility with Bose’s Connect app to get firmware updates and
customize settings. The speaker is a solid deal at full price, but at 50% off it’s very tough to pass up. —Ryan Waniata
JBL’s popular Go speaker is a truly travel-ready sonic companion. It’s got the durability you need, including IP67 dust and water
resistance that lets you hit the turf or surf anxiety free. The palm-sized speaker isn’t exactly a bass-bomber, but it provides
clear and relatively full sound with solid definition in a fun package that comes in a wide range of colors (though be careful as
not all of them are priced the same). We’ve seen the speaker sell as high as $50 recently, which is a stretch considering its
mediocre 5-hour battery life, but at around $30 this rugged rocker provides good value. —Ryan Waniata
I’ve tried . While you won’t find my favorite Sangean radios on sale (sad!) I also really like Tivoli’s Pal radio. It’s got a
modern style to it you won’t find in most radios – they’re frequently styled with midcentury and retro finishes – and comes in a
bunch of vibrant colors, making it a fun pop of color to add in your home. The battery design means you don’t need to place it
near an outlet, and instead can move it around wherever you like (Various spots in the living room! The garage! The park! The
campsite of your choice!) and jam to your radio station of choice. It also doubles as a Bluetooth speaker. —Nena Farrell

The Logitech G735 is an older headset, but still a solid one that we recently revisited as part of . It has plush, comfy ear cups
and a stylish ring of RGB lights along the outside. Reviewer Nena Farrell found them to be designed for smaller head sizes, but
still only snug if you’re more cranially endowed. Even still, they’re light enough that you could almost forget that you’re
wearing them. They might be a little bit outdated at this point, but with support for 3.5-mm audio, Bluetooth, and Logitech’s own
Lightspeed wireless connection, it’s still a robust headset at a reasonable price. —Eric Ravenscraft
Anything we review here at WIRED rarely gets a perfect 10/10, but the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless . HyperX claimed this headset
gets up to 300 hours of battery life, which is about 10 times more than most competing headsets can achieve. I put that claim to
the test … and it exceeded 325 hours. It’s not often we come across a company that claims to beat the competition by 10 times,
much less one that goes even further. The ear cups are comfy, the audio quality is great, and the mic is solid for team chat, but
that battery life is the star of this show. —Eric Ravenscraft
If there's a bell and/or whistle you could ask for in a gaming headset, the Arctis Nova Pro likely has it. The headset comes with
a robust GameDAC that comes equipped with a ton of EQ features to customize your sound to your exact preferences, as well as tools
to mix sidetone, team chat, and game audio so you can hear exactly what you need to hear at any given moment. The GameDAC supports
two USB-C inputs, so you can play on multiple consoles without having to swap cables. I loved the wireless version of this headset
WIRED contributor Henrí tried a few low-profile mechanical keyboards that reminded him of “glorified laptop keyboards” before
finding the Lofree Flow88 which employs in a gasket-mounted metal case. He says typing is smooth and satisfying, and the
unconventional switches are well-used in the durable build. —Martin Cizmar
SteelSeries’ mechanical keyboards have bright, colorful LEDs and your choice of several satisfying switch types, but the standout
feature that makes the Apex 7 TKL (and its siblings) unique is its built-in OLED display. This display can show notification info
and system alerts, and monitor things like CPU usage or temperature. It might not be life-changing, but I’ve found it to be a nice
little convenience that I can use to keep an eye on my system without having to pull up the Windows Task Manager or a system
monitoring app. This model lops off the 10-key numpad on the right, which can save a lot of precious desktop space and is
particularly handy when playing FPS games like Overwatch 2, where making big, sweeping mouse movements can mean the difference
This is one of our older keyboard picks, but it’s still a solid option for a lot of people. Its tactile switches are among the
most satisfying we’ve tested, and it’s compatible with most custom keycaps, so you can tweak the board to your exact,
hyper-specific preferences. While numpads might not be the most popular feature out there, I’m particularly partial to them, so
I’m happy that this 96 percent keyboard keeps them. The keyboard’s casing is made of plastic, but it’s high-quality material that
doesn’t feel like it’s cheaping out compared to aluminum, like many plastic keyboards do. —Eric Ravenscraft
The Corsair K100 is a unique keyboard, thanks mainly to its customizable wheel on the upper left side. This is a feature most
keyboards don’t have, but it’s incredibly handy for things like scrubbing through media or controlling the timeline in video
editing applications. If you’re a media professional, there are several presets for Adobe apps like Premiere, After Effects, and
Photoshop. I’m a big fan of , and the K100 has some unique options for doing so that I can’t find anywhere else. It doesn’t hurt
This is one of our —a new guide we launched to focus specifically on mechanical boards by WIRED contributor Henri Robbins, who is
deeply ingrained in this space. Seriously, he pulls apart keyboards just to see how the manufacturer assembled them with each
review. You might be surprised then to see that he liked the BlackWidow V4 () board from a big-name brand like Razer. That's
because this is the company's first real foray into the world of custom mechanical keyboards, and aside from the fact that opening
the case voids the warranty, it's a well-built board with hot-swap sockets, great tactile switches, and a metal-top case.
If there’s another microphone as recognizable as a Blue Yeti, it’s probably the HyperX Quadcast S (). Twitch streamers in
particular gravitate to this mic because, in addition to picking up excellent audio over USB without needing complicated extra
hardware, it comes with RGB LEDs built-in. The LEDs sit under a mesh of circular cutouts, giving the mic an iconic look that
catches the eye on camera. It also has convenient features like a large, tappable mute button and a gain knob built into the
bottom of the mic, all of which make it easy to control your audio while you’re managing your stream. —Eric Ravenscraft
Nothing says “for gamers” like slapping a bunch of RGB LEDs on something, which means this mesh Wi-Fi system from Asus is
screaming it. This system is easy to set up and supports Wi-Fi 6 and , including blistering fast speeds over both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz
bands. Asus has tricked this router out with features to prioritize gaming devices so you can minimize lag in online, competitive
games. But all of that is secondary to the most important feature: that grid of LEDs on the front in the shape of the Rog logo. It
glows red by default, but you can tweak it to any color you want. That makes your games better, right? —Eric Ravenscraft
The Scuf Instinct Pro controller is and once you get your hands on it, it’s not hard to see why. Or feel, as the case may be. It
has a satisfyingly grippy texture, a matte black finish, and plenty of customizable extra buttons. This includes four rear
flippers you can customize with up to 16 different controller functions. This makes the controller excellent for complex,
class-based games like Overwatch 2. While it’s technically compatible with PC, reviewer Simon Hill found it best suited for Xbox
games, where the controller layout most resembles what the games are designed for. —Eric Ravenscraft
You can save a lot of money by opting for a , and you don’t have to worry about charging. The GameSir G7 is our top pick because
it feels like a regular Xbox controller but boasts Hall Effect analog triggers, customizable back paddles, a hair trigger mode,
four rumble motors, and swappable faceplates that you can paint. —Simon Hill
Plugging in an SSD isn’t usually a difficult process, but on the Xbox Series X/S, it couldn’t be simpler. The consoles have a
dedicated storage expansion slot on the back for cards like this 1-TB SSD from Seagate. Just pop it in and your console instantly
has more room for all the games you want to download. The expansion card features the same speed as the internal SSD in the Xbox
console so you won’t notice any difference in load times either. The only (extremely minor) downside is that the expansion card
sticks out about an inch from the back of the console, but it doesn’t take up more space than the ends of the cables that also
plug into the back, so it’s unlikely it will affect how you arrange your devices. —Eric Ravenscraft
Curved, ultrawide monitors provide an incredibly immersive experience, and this QD-OLED display from Alienware () does an amazing
job at it. It has the characteristic infinite blacks of most other OLED displays, but with better color accuracy and less wasted
energy. The 34-inch screen is pretty large, but the 3,440 x 1,400 resolution means that text is still super crisp and readable
from a typical sitting distance, and the HDR Peak 1000 mode emits so much light (aptly, 1,000 nits) that reviewer Simon Hill said
he had to squint while playing on it at night. —Eric Ravenscraft
I type to you from this very monitor, or at least from a laptop connected to this very monitor. The Philips Creator Series 27-inch
has a ton of features I love in , from a 4K screen to an adjustable base with a VESA mount. But it has my favorite thing of all
these days: a . I’m able to connect both my work laptop and personal gaming laptop to the monitor using the included cords (you’ll
need to follow the instructions to make sure all cords are connected right) and then connect my speakers, keyboard, and mouse to
the monitor to easily switch them between computers. It’s super convenient if you have two different computers you’re using
This is the kind of monitor that’s great for gamers but works just as well for getting your everyday work done. It packs a 1,440p
LCD TFT display, which isn’t quite as color-accurate as some of the higher-end gaming monitors I’ve tested, but the resolution is
high enough that text is crisp and details come through clear. The 165-Hz refresh rate isn’t the speediest, but it’s still plenty
to keep up with most modern, fast-paced games. I’m not a fan of the recessed mounting screws that can make it a little wonky to
attach to some VESA mounts, but the included stand is pretty solid on its own so it’s not a huge problem. —Eric Ravenscraft
Logitech’s Pro X 2 gaming headset is , thanks to its comfy ear cups, 7.1 surround soundstage, and ultra-low latency connection
using the company’s proprietary Lightspeed wireless connection. On top of this, the Pro X 2 supports a Bluetooth connection, which
its predecessor didn’t, as well as a 3.5 mm input for wired audio. I test a lot of gaming headsets, but I often end up falling
back on these as a daily driver because they’re just that comfortable and sound that good. It doesn’t hurt that they last up to 50
hours on a single charge, more than long enough to get me through all the Overwatch 2 games I play in a given week. —Eric
In our guide to , we recommend this 1,000-watt power supply as a good option for desktop computers that have multiple graphics
cards or an excess of storage. It’s quiet, fast, and efficient. The modular design isn’t particularly unique when it comes to
power supplies—most PSUs around this price point are fully modular— but it’s still a nice feature to have. —Louryn Strampe
The Meta Quest 3 is a substantial upgrade over the Quest 2, and comes with an appropriately higher price tag. While the previous
model had some rudimentary visual pass-through features, the Quest 3 reconstructs a full-color view of your surroundings with its
external cameras, enabling a ton of AR games that weren’t possible in previous VR headsets. Combined with higher resolution
screens, upgraded controllers, and a sturdy headset strap that’s not sold as an optional add-on (like with the Quest 2), the
gaming experience on the Quest 3 is a bulky head and shoulder above its predecessor. —Eric Ravenscraft
The SteelSeries Arena 7 () are incredible-sounding desktop speakers that have built-in RGB LED lights. That means your soundscape
becomes a lightscape! Included is a 6.5-inch subwoofer that can be almost too powerful, which means gaming will be more immersive
than ever. The speakers can be used with consoles, phones, and computers. They’d make an if you yourself don’t need the upgrade.
When you’re , the motherboard is one of the most crucial elements. The motherboard is the “base” of your desktop—everything else
plugs into it. We recommend the Gigabyte B650 if you’re building a mid- to high-end PC using an AMD processor. It’s got plenty of
dedicated slots for memory and storage, an easy-to-use BIOS, and a pretty straightforward layout. There are nice extras, too, like
support for addressable LED and a few built-in Thunderbolt ports. If you’ve built a computer before, you might not even need to
consult the manual when putting everything together (though, when in doubt, you always should). —Louryn Strampe
A processor is one of the most important components when it comes to . We recommend this as a great AMD option for gaming or
editing rigs. It isn’t the fastest or most powerful of the bunch, but it should still be more than enough for most use
cases—especially if you’re not trying to spend a whole lot of money. It’ll be able to handle modern games and video editing, and
it’ll do it for much less than higher-end alternatives. —Louryn Strampe
Sixty percent keyboards are among the smallest you can get, and the Razer Huntsman Mini is . It drops the numpad, arrow keys,
function keys, and basically anything else it can get away with cutting. The Huntsman Mini is still just as responsive and
satisfying as keyboards twice its size, but it leaves you a lot more extra space on your desk. The small, white frame is stylish
and looks great in a tidy workspace. It’s also small enough to toss in a bag if you want to take it with you, though personally I
This PC case from MSI is one of our picks in our guide to . It’s a budget-friendly option that’s a little tight on space, but
makes up for it with stylish tempered glass and a boatload of large, LED-laden fans. The smoky glass filters some of the LED light
so you can fill your PC with all the rave lights you like without blinding anyone who walks in the same room as your rig. Given
the space constraints, you should make sure that all your components fit before you buy this one, and be prepared to do some fancy
The Razer Kishi V2 is one of our honorable mentions when it comes to mobile game controllers. Like the others in our guide, you
can attach the two halves of this device to the side of your phone to turn it into a Switch-like game console. Compared to other
similar controllers, this one is … fine. It’s fine! It’s solid, has an extendable bridge to fit the exact size of your phone, and
it works with streaming games from PlayStation, Xbox, or PC. Normally we might recommend something else in our guide, but if you
can catch this one on sale (like now), then it’s worth picking up. —Eric Ravenscraft

If you need a very compact, folding, 3-in-1 charger, look no further. Anker’s MagGo 3-in-1 is perfect for travel and can
wirelessly charge MagSafe iPhones or Qi2-certified phones at up to 15 watts. There’s also a pad for AirPods or other wireless
earbuds and a fold-out Apple Watch charger. You get a 5-foot USB-C cable and power adapter with it. The fold-up stand allows you
to place magnetic-backed phones in portrait or landscape orientation while they charge. This clever gadget appears in our , , and
This is a great hybrid wireless charging stand. In addition to your phone (it supports both iPhones and Androids), you can charge
another device on the rubberized charging pad beside it—which we like to use to charge our wireless earbuds. It comes with a cable
and adapter too. The stand can also be used in either portrait or landscape, but it’s important to note that if you choose the
latter, you’ll block the pad next to it. We don’t suggest placing this on your nightstand though, because the LED on the front can
be glaring (making it tough to sleep). But it looks pretty, with fabric wrapped around the stand, so you shouldn’t have trouble
If your iPhone is forever running out of juice, a MagSafe power bank can help top it off without you having to stop to plug in.
Anker’s MagGo Portable Charger is the best of the because it’s slim, comes in fun colors, and can add between 50 and 80 percent to
your iPhone battery. The fold-out stand is a handy extra that lets you prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation for
video calls or recording TikToks. It’s compact enough to slip in a pocket or bag and comes with a USB-C cable. You can also charge
other devices using the two-way USB-C port on the edge. —Simon Hill
The , developed in partnership with Apple, introduces MagSafe-style magnetism for perfect alignment and a fast wireless charging
rate of up to 15 watts. This chunky power bank from Anker boasts a 10,000 mAh capacity, enough to charge most phones twice. It
also has a handy LED display showing remaining power as a percentage, a kickstand, and a USB-C port that can deliver up to 27
watts (a short USB-C cable is provided). So far, only iPhones support Qi2, but it is backward compatible, so it can charge any Qi
phone, just at a slower rate. This is our Qi2 pick of the . —Simon Hill
All-in on Samsung? This charger is a bit long in the tooth; it’s not the fastest , nor does it have the latest specs, but it’ll
juice up three devices—a Qi-compatible phone, a wireless earbuds case, and Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series with no trouble. (Just
make sure your watch is supported). It’s one of the few wireless chargers out there that support Samsung’s smartwatches. —Julian
I love translucent electronics, but this power bank isn’t just good-looking, it also has a color display showing a detailed
readout of the voltage, current, and power flowing in or out of each port. Dig into the menu, and you can find stats showing
temperature, cycles, and more. It has USB-C, USB-A, and DC barrel ports, supports several fast charging protocols, and comes with
a yellow 100-watt USB-C to USB-C cable and a wee bag. The 25,600mAh capacity means it is capable of charging a laptop. It has
dropped as low as this before, but only for Lightning Deals. The excellent, triangular is also on sale at $144 ($26 off). —Simon
Belkin’s BoostCharge Power Bank sits in the honorable mentions section of our , but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve
tracked. It has a 5,000-mAh capacity, so don’t expect it to fully recharge an iPhone from zero to 100 percent. But it comes in
some nice colors, and there’s a kickstand (though it works best in landscape orientation). The magnets feel a bit weak in this
I love devices that combine functions and help you save space, and Satechi’s wireless charging headphone stand is a prime example.
A mix of black and chrome, it blends in with any decor. There’s a well-designed headphone rest with cable management on the stem,
and you’ll find a magnetic wireless charging pad in the base. It can wirelessly charge iPhones at 7.5 watts and other Qi phones at
As one of the biggest names in , Anker’s expansion into seemed like a natural fit. The Solix series combines attractive design
with useful features, and the C1000 is our pick for camping trips. It has a LiFePO4 battery with a 1,056-watt-hour capacity.
Built-in handles make it relatively easy to carry. It can charge up all your small gadgets or power devices, such as a small
fridge, TV, or power drill. There is an XT60 input to charge from solar panels. We have seen the C1000 drop to $600 before but
this is a new low. Anker also has some bundle deals combining power stations and solar panels on sale, such as the larger . —Simon
We love this handy little jump starter so much, . It’s a portable battery pack that can jump-start most cars. It doesn’t take up
too much space in the trunk or your backseat, but it can be a real lifesaver if you end up needing it—like WIRED reviewer Eric
Ravenscraft did when he discovered that his alternator was going bad while out of state. This pack has a built-in flashlight, and
it can charge your phone in a pinch as well. Better safe than sorry! —Louryn Strampe

nearly 1.4 pounds. A smart digital display shows the remaining battery percentage, and you can tap the power button to cycle

fast-charging your gadgets and boasts a handy 2,042-watt-hour capacity. You can expand it with modular battery packs, use it as an
emergency power supply (EPS), and charge it multiple ways, including from a wall outlet or solar panels. It is bulky and heavy,
but there’s a telescopic handle and wheels to make it easier to lug around. It worked very well in my tests, powering various
devices with ease, and it is relatively quiet in operation. The LiFePO4 battery should be good for 10 years, and Jackery offers a
If you need plenty of portable power, Bluetti’s AC200L has you covered with a 2,048-watt-hour capacity, a generous array of ports
and outlets, and an expandable design that can go all the way up to 8,196 Wh. It has reliable LiFePO4 batteries inside that can be
charged from any outlet, solar panels, or even your car (cables provided). The 2,400-watt maximum output is enough for appliances,
and there’s a surge mode that allows up to 3,600 watts briefly. It also works as an uninterruptible power supply with a

Juice up your gadgets in more than 150 countries with this affordable adapter from Epicka. Sliders reveal the three most common
international plugs—EU, UK, and US—and you can rotate the pins for sockets in Australia or China. As well as a socket, you get
four USB-A ports on the bottom and a 15-watt USB-C port on the side for phones, tablets, smartwatches, and Kindles. It’s not
grounded, but there is an 8-amp fuse for safety, and it comes with a spare. This is the budget pick in our guide, so it’s already
cheap, but we’ve never seen it lower than $20. —Simon Hill
I’ve been using Zendure’s all-in-one travel adapters for years now. The Passport III has a boxy design with sliding toggles to
switch between US, European, and British plugs. (It covers more than 200 countries.) The auto-resetting fuse protects your gadgets
from power surges, and it has a 10-amp limit. I also love the funky, translucent design with a metallic finish (purple is best).
Four USB-C ports, alongside a single USB-A port and an AC socket, let you charge six devices simultaneously. It can fast charge
most phones and charge laptops, with up to 65 watts from the USB-C. The upgrade pick in our guide, this universal travel adapter
was expensive when it was first released, but it has come down in price significantly. —Simon Hill
This is our . The company offers the best quality for the money, and the Travel umbrella is a good everyday umbrella size. It

slightly but stay sturdy. The Teflon fabric is quick to dry. It’s just under a pound, though the canopy is a bit small—it’s
This stroller just arrived at my home to test for our guide to strollers. I was intrigued by the cargo mode that lets the sides
fold down flat to cart things around, or you can also lower the sides to make it easier for your bossy toddler (don’t mind me
projecting here) to get out on his own, because he absolutely does not want your help. You also fold it down flat to store it,
reminding me of what I like about the more expensive Veer wagon. Will it unseat the Veer for me? I’m not sure yet, but if you want
something similar to a Veer without paying Veer prices, this is the closest I’ve found but with way more built-in storage. —Nena
This convertible car seat is popular for a reason. I’ve tried a couple different car seats, and I’m always so happy with how easy
the straps are to maneuver on the Graco Extend2Fit, and they don’t get stuck or twisted as often as other car seats I’ve used. My
kid started using this car seat when he was around 9 months old and grew out of the infant car seat (gotta love having a tall
kid!), and it’s been easy to adjust as he gets taller and taller. It’s been easy to take out and pop into other cars when my
parents babysit. I’m counting down the days till my kid is 2, because 2-year-olds can have their car seats facing forward, and
it’ll be so much easier to hand him snacks or toys while I drive once we’re both facing the same way. And there’s no new car seat
required—we’ll just unbuckle the Extend2Fit, flip it around, and secure it back into the car. Voila! —Nena Farrell
People who love cameras are meticulous and conscientious by nature, which I say by way of explaining exactly why it took WIRED

This is a top recommendation in our . The Wandrd Transit is great for everyday use but also can handle a weekend trip just fine,
and it doesn’t stick out as a camera bag. I tested the 35-liter model, which can fit in a lot of gear via the Essential Camera
Cube (not included). The area above where the cube sits can fit a day’s worth of clothes (and a bit more). There are plenty of
pouches, pockets, and sleeves to fit chargers, laptops, audio equipment, and even a tripod in the side pocket. It can handle the
elements without issue and is compliant as a carry-on with most airlines. This is part of a broader 20 percent off Prime Day sale
Our , the Wandrd Rogue comes in several sizes. I tested the largest 9-liter model and it has been my go-to sling whenever I travel
by bike or scooter. You can cinch it as a sling, messenger, or waist pack, and it has enough room for my mirrorless camera and two
lenses. I also regularly attach a tripod to the bottom straps, and it all feels fairly compact. —Julian Chokkattu

and purple. You can also get the smoky blue color for $140, which is still a good price, but not as low as the $130 you can get
the yellow and purple colors for. This washable travel blanket has a waterproof bottom, comes with a travel bag, and has enough
weight to it that you don't have to worry about it flying away. —Nena Farrell

This is the lowest price we've seen on our . The Bishop Pass offers the best warmth-to-weight ratio while also managing to pack
down small and not be too expensive. It isn't perfect, but it strikes the best compromise for most backpackers. I have slept in
this bag for more than two weeks, with nighttime temps ranging from 28 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and, yes, it was too much in the
heat, but on those warmer nights, I unzipped it and covered myself like a warm blanket. It's a versatile bag. —Scott Gilbertson
Rab's Expedition 1200 is the warmer cousin of . This deal is only on the short size, but if that fits you, you'd be hard-pressed
to find a better deal on a very warm sleeping bag. Its 1,000 grams of 850-fill-power hydrophobic goose down retains warmth but

A fire pit can be a great addition to any backyard. If you can, build one yourself, but if you can't, Solo Stove's Yukon 2.0 () is

The Ranger used to be the baby of the Solo firepit family, but with the advent of the tabletop models that's not true anymore.

I own the slightly older version of this Deuter day pack, and the suspension system is so comfortable that I regularly load it

This is a nice compact standing desk, though you can get it in a larger size. You have several different tops to choose from to
match your home office’s aesthetic. There’s a paddle on the corner to push the desk up or down, and it has two height presets.
Setting these presets isn’t super intuitive, so make sure to follow the manual. It was easy to put together. —Julian Chokkattu

This is not technically a Prime Day deal, but it is a good one. We love the Hero 12, it’s . It’s the camera a reach for when I
head out to door. It’s got good battery life, excellent stabilization, and it overheats far less than previous models. The only
real downside is it dropped GPS support. If you want that you can add a separate GPS accessory or go for the GoPro 11 below.

Once , the A7III remains a solid choice, especially on sale for under $1,300. The 24 megapixel sensor can capture 15 stops of
dynamic range in 14-bit uncompressed RAW files and the autofocus, while that as good as the A7IV or A7V, is still solid. It can

save you some money that you can dedicate to lenses. —Scott Gilbertson
Insta360's X3 () has been superseded by the X4 (, but not on sale), but it's still a great 360 and action camera combo. The sensor
is capable of 5.7K 360 video (that yields 1,080p video when cropping to flat formats like online video) and shoots 4K video in
single lens mode. The battery life is good and it's dead simple to use with voice commands and a large, bright screen.

These are the larger siblings of the TrailSeeker 8x32 binoculars, which we love (). The difference there is the size of the front

Last year Amazon introduced invite-only deals—a system to help make it easier for Prime members to access deals that are expected
to sell out quickly—and the company brought it back for Prime Big Deal Days. The feature is only available on select products but
it has spread across a variety of categories and price points.
If a specific product is part of the Invite-Only Deals system, you'll see a “Request Invite” button on the right-hand side. All
you have to do is click it for a chance to buy the product at that sale price. However, it's important to note that there's no

Thanks to Amazon Prime Day, you don’t need to wait until Black Friday this year to save big on Apple gadgets. Despite being an
Amazon event, some of the best deals surprisingly include popular Apple products, ranging from the high-end to the entry-level —
both of which have new all-time low prices.
It’s not just AirPods that are receiving steep discounts, though, but also the , the , and other excellent Apple devices. Below,
we’ve rounded up the cream of the crop to make diving through the deals easier. If you’re interested in deals outside of the Apple
ecosystem, so you can save even more.
The second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard
volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning. .
Apple’s third-gen AirPods have a new design and sound significantly better than their predecessors. They also add new features
like head tracking for spatial audio. .
Compared to their predecessors, the Beats Studio Pro feature improved noise cancellation, sound quality, and comfort. They were
the first Apple headphones to support lossless audio over USB-C, too, and probably are your best option if you frequently switch
between iOS and Android devices. .
The Beats Studio Buds Plus offer better sound and noise cancellation than the original pair, and they now come in a unique
translucent color option. .
The Apple Watch Series 9 features a brand-new S9 processor that enables offline Siri use, brighter displays, and the double tap
gesture. It also has the second-gen ultra wideband chip for Precision Finding if you have an iPhone 15. .
The rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple’s lineup, along
with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple’s new S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s
new double tap feature. .
Apple’s 10th-gen iPad is the spiritual successor to the older ninth-gen model. In exchange for its revised design,
landscape-oriented webcam, USB-C port, larger 10.9-inch screen, and faster processor, it ditched the headphone jack and got more
expensive. .
In addition to the 11-inch model, the newest iPad Air is also available in a 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M2 processor. It
features a Liquid Retina display, new horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro and the
bigger version of Apple’s last-gen Magic Keyboard. .
Apple’s revamped iPad Mini ditches the home button and opts for a larger edge-to-edge display. It also comes outfitted with a
faster processor, support for USB-C, and a top-mounted power button that moonlights as a Touch ID sensor.
Apple’s latest iPad Pro is the first Apple device with an M4 processor and an OLED-based Ultra Retina XDR display. It also
features an improved camera system with adaptive flash and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro and the newest Magic Keyboard.
The Apple Pencil Pro arrives with new features like Find My support so you can find the stylus when it gets lost as well as new
creative capabilities like squeeze gestures and the “Barrel Roll” gyroscope.
The second-gen Apple Pencil ditches the awkward Lightning port charging, adopting a magnetic charging mechanism that attaches to
the side of the many iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini models. It also supports tap gestures.
The MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports
dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will
meet your needs — it just will. .
The M2-powered Mac Mini is a fast desktop suitable for everyday work while touting perks like an HDMI 2.0 output and an ethernet
jack capable of gigabit speeds. .
The 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a
better display than its predecessor, while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging. .
Apple’s latest iMac is a refresh of the 24-inch design from 2021 with a new M3 processor, Wi-Fi 6E, and the same 4.5K (4480 x
The 27-inch Studio Display can be customized with glare-resistant coating and a more maneuverable stand at an extra cost. It

The yellow iPhone 14 is equipped with Apple’s A15 Bionic CPU and a 6.1-inch display and is available with onboard storage ranging
from 128GB to 512GB. .
With the introduction of the iPhone 15, Apple lowered the price on the 13 to $599. If you’re paying upfront rather than
subsidizing your purchase with a carrier, then it’s a great option. .
Apple’s AirTags can help you find your lost items with its UWB technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an iPhone,
though Apple released an Android app to detect an AirTag’s location if one seems to be following you. .

APPLE HAS JUST REVEALED THE FULL SLATE OF IMMERSIVE CONTENT COMING TO THE VISION PRO THIS YEAR, INCLUDING CONCERTS, NBA ACTION,
AND A SHORT FILM FIRST.
By , a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer
and editor at MUO.
Apple is launching new “immersive” video content for the Vision Pro over the next few months, including one from The Weeknd, a
close-up view of the 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend, and “the first scripted short film captured in Apple Immersive Video.” The will

The immersive performance from The Weeknd will arrive on the Vision Pro later this year, while you can expect a short film
featuring events from the NBA All-Star Game this fall, such as the Rising Stars Challenge, the slam dunk contest, and the All-Star
Game.

that invites viewers to experience once-in-a-lifetime trips from wherever they are” at 9PM ET on July 18th. Here’s some of the
All this adds to the immersive content Apple has already brought to the Vision Pro, including Adventure, Alicia Keys: Rehearsal
Room, and Prehistoric Planet Immersive. Apple says that “more series, films, concerts, and sports captured in Apple Immersive
Video will be released this year,” helped by a new Blackmagic camera, as well as updates to DaVinci Resolve Studio and Apple

Amazon Prime Day 2024 is here and, with it, a whole bunch of deals on Apple Watches, Android smartwatches, or even just a regular

ON THE VERGECAST: A DEEP DIVE INTO THE HISTORY OF THE ROKU NETFLIX PLAYER, HOW TO PLAY MUSIC IN YOUR CAR, AND MUCH MORE.

Wall Street Journal, and Wired.
Before Roku was a leading player in the streaming wars, with that ubiquitous purple screensaver and a library of original content
and practically every streaming app you could possibly imagine, it was a Netflix gadget — the first Netflix gadget, for that
matter, and the one that helped start a streaming revolution. But the Roku story was almost very different.
On , we try out a couple of show formats we’ve been planning for a while. First, we debut our tech-rewatch segment, in the vein of
some of our favorite rewatch shows like , , and . We’re calling it Version History, at least for now. For this first segment, we
tell the story of the Roku Netflix Player, debate its legacy, and try to decide whether this thing belongs in the Version History
Hall of Fame. The exact qualifications for said Hall of Fame? Still very much TBD.
After that, we have another take on our as-yet-untitled debate show. In this one, Nilay Patel and David Pierce yell at each other
about who should own the screens in your car. Are CarPlay and Android Auto the answer, the solution to universally crappy
automaker software? Or should Google and Apple get out of the way and let carmakers build what’s required for the self-driving,
automated, infinitely more immersive future of driving? Things get heated. Names are called.

THE APPLE WATCH SERIES 10 MAY GET AN ULTRA-SIZED SCREEN
THE APPLE WATCH SERIES 10 MAY GET AN ULTRA-SIZED SCREEN
MEANWHILE, A CHEAPER, PLASTIC WATCH SE COULD BE IN THE OFFING.
By , a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist
since 2020.
Here’s some potentially good news for Apple Watch owners who have Apple Watch Ultra screen envy: the Apple Watch Series 10 — may
get the same size screen as the company’s 49mm outdoorsy watch. That’s in addition to other possible improvements, like a thinner
case and a new chip that could “lay the groundwork for some AI enhancements down the road,” .
The screen rumor seems to back up a that showed a Series 10 watch with a two-inch display. Gurman says — and that render appears
to show — that the watch won’t otherwise feature any major design changes. If that means no magnetic watch strap attachments or
whatever, I’m putting that part of the rumor in the “good” column — like many, I’ve accumulated a number of watch straps over the
years, and I’d like to keep using them if I decide to upgrade.
As for new sensors, that seems cloudier, as Gurman says Apple is struggling with two big health sensor updates it’s been planning.
The company reportedly hasn’t been able to get its rumored blood pressure monitor’s reliability up to snuff, and he writes that
not being able to use is hampering its efforts to add sleep apnea detection.
Apple is reportedly planning a cheaper version of the Apple Watch SE to bring pricing in line with Samsung’s . One way it might do
this, apparently, is with a rigid plastic case. That could make the watch cheaper, sure, and perhaps lighter — I can think of at
least that could stand to benefit from a similar decision! (The Vision Pro. I’m talking about the Vision Pro.)
Finally, Gurman says that the company is planning to release a Watch Ultra 3, but don’t expect big visual changes. It will
reportedly get the new chip that will power the Series 10, though.

Apple has chosen App Store chief and former marketing head Phil Schiller to represent the company on OpenAI’s nonprofit board,

director.
Joining the board will allow Schiller to learn more about the inner workings of OpenAI as Apple works to . The integration will

Bloomberg, , though Apple is expected to get a percentage of ChatGPT subscriptions made through its platforms down the road.
Last year, the board that controls OpenAI in a non-voting observer position. Having both Apple and Microsoft on OpenAI’s board
could make discussing plans with either company more complex. As Bloomberg notes, it’s quite rare for Apple execs to take board
seats at companies they partner with.

Over the past month or so, we’ve seen a flurry of new Bluetooth trackers, from Motorola’s forthcoming to . That being said, if
you’re an iPhone user, Apple’s AirTag remains the best option — one you can still grab at and for an all-time low of $23.99 ($5
off). You can also buy a four-pack of trackers at and for around $89 ($10 off), though be aware that you can often buy the bundle
for $15 less.
Despite having launched several years ago, Apple’s AirTags pack plenty of utility. The ultra wideband (UWB) location trackers
provide ultra-precise tracking if you’re embedded in the Apple ecosystem, as they allow you to easily leverage the company’s
extensive Find My network to locate your lost belongings. The handy accessories also sport an IP67 rating — meaning they’re sealed
against dust and can handle some water immersion — and run on a single CR2032 coin cell battery, which isn’t the case with all
Bluetooth trackers. You can even if your iPhone is running iOS 17 or later, making them a great choice if you’re hoping to keep
tabs on your car keys and other household items you’d rather not lose track of.
Apple’s AirTags can help you find your lost items with their ultra wideband technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an
iPhone, though Apple released an Android app that can detect an AirTag’s location and notify you if one seems to be following you.

APPLE PAY IS CONVENIENT AND BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN ME
APPLE PAY IS CONVENIENT AND BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN ME
ONE WOMAN’S QUEST TO FIND HER MISSING WALLET.
By , a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the
New Right.
A few days ago, I misplaced my wallet. I remember having it on Sunday, the night of my friend’s birthday dinner, because I was the
one to put my card down. Maybe I had it on Monday. I didn’t spend any money then aside from a Lyft ride home, which famously
doesn’t require you to swipe a card, so there’s no way to know for sure. And even when I did spend money — a case of La Croix at
the bodega, an iced latte as a reward for going to the laundromat — my wallet never factored into the equation. I use Apple Pay
for almost every purchase, both because it’s easy and convenient and because, unlike my wallet, my phone is something I actually
can’t live without.
It wasn’t until Wednesday that my lack of a wallet became an issue. I didn’t need it to take the subway to a meeting, nor did I
need it to get a coffee at said meeting. I didn’t need it to take the train downtown to The Verge’s office — it turns out I needed
my ID to get into the building, but we found a way around that. (I showed the receptionist a photo of my driver’s license on my
phone.) My wallet-free existence could have been a problem again that night: as I biked to the bar to meet my friends, I wondered
if I’d be turned away at the door or when ordering a drink. I was not. The next day, at a wine bar, I used my phone to pay for my
share of the bottle I split with a friend.
Wallet or no wallet, I can still get around. Crucially, I can still spend money. It’s a completely seamless process — one that has
enabled me to be more forgetful and more careless about my spending.
Apple in 2014, promising to disrupt the “fairly antiquated payment process” of swiping a card. “The whole process is based on this
little piece of plastic, whether it’s a credit or debit card,” CEO Tim Cook said at the time. “We’re totally reliant on the
exposed numbers, and the outdated and vulnerable magnetic interface — which by the way is five decades old — and the security
I kept relying on the exposed numbers and outdated interface for years, mostly out of stubbornness. I was 20 years old and
terrible with the little money I had when Apple Pay first launched. If anything, I needed my purchases to have more friction, not
less. Every penny I spent was precious. I’d write down all my expenses in a little notebook, color-coding them for good measure.
By forcing myself to think about where my money was going, I shamed myself into spending less of it.
Even then, I was losing my wallet all the time. There was a two-month stretch the following summer where I left it on the subway,
had it returned to me by a kind stranger who tracked me down on Facebook, and then left it at Yankee Stadium, where I never saw it
again. But losing my wallet used to have consequences, and the threat of those consequences — losing my MetroCard, not being able
to buy myself lunch, not being able to go out with my friends — made me somewhat more careful.
I finally caved in April 2020, though not entirely by choice. You know what was happening then — I don’t need to remind you. But
let me set the scene: I had walked 20 minutes to the good grocery store, waited another 30 minutes in line to be let in (it was a
different time!), grabbed a week’s worth of food, and got to the front of the checkout line, where I realized… I didn’t have my
wallet. I called my roommate, who dutifully read my credit card number to me while I typed it into Apple Pay. Unfortunately, I
never looked back.
It’s not Apple’s fault that I lose my wallet all the time, but Apple does bear some responsibility for ushering in this new world
where all you need is your phone. In some ways, I’m the kind of model Apple consumer: no wallet, no ID, just Apple Pay and vibes.
And now here I am, more forgetful than ever, aided and abetted by a world where contactless payments have become the norm. I ended
up finding my wallet this morning at the bottom of a tote bag. My credit card, however, is still missing, but it doesn’t really
even matter.

Samsung SmartThings looks set to become the first major smart home platform to fully support . According to a , the SmartThings
platform now works with Matter 1.2, so manufacturers and developers can start integrating their compatible devices with the
platform. The SmartThings app won’t be updated to support Matter until later this summer — so you won’t be able to control your
Matter-compatible or through SmartThings until then.
Samsung also announced several other updates to its smart home platform, including app design improvements, new device control
options, a hub backup option, shareable routines, and the gamification of its SmartThings Energy feature.
Support for Matter 1.2 in SmartThings means — developed jointly by Apple, Amazon, Google, Samsung, and others — will now work with
Samsung’s smart home platform.
This includes refrigerators, room air conditioners, dishwashers, washing machines, robot vacuums, smoke and carbon monoxide
detectors, air quality sensors, air purifiers, and fans. You’ll be able to add the devices directly to the SmartThings app via
Matter, control them, and receive notifications and alerts through the app.
The SmartThings platform already supports many of these appliances, both its own Samsung brand as well as those from (including
Thermador, Bosch, and Dacor). But those are generally through cloud integrations.
Matter will bring these integrations local, which should mean faster response times and the ability to control devices even if
your internet is down. While Samsung’s connected appliances work with the SmartThings app, they are not Matter certified. This
means they only work with the SmartThings app, whereas Matter appliances can work with any smart home platform that supports
Matter.
Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home have yet to add support for Matter 1.2
However, the other major platforms, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home, have yet to add support for Matter 1.2. Apple later
this year, but there’s no word on any of the other device types. Home Assistant supports Matter 1.2, but its . While , bringing
support for energy management, microwave ovens, ovens, electric cooktops, extractor hoods, and electric dryers, it’s unclear when
we’ll see widespread platform support.
There are currently only a handful of Matter-certified appliances in the newly supported categories — robot vacuums, and being
some examples. But now that one of the major platforms has announced support, I expect we’ll see manufacturers enabling it in
their appliances. (which owns KitchenAid and Maytag), , , and (which owns GE Appliances) are all notable brands that have said
their products will support Matter.

Developed by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung (and ), Matter is an , IP-based connectivity software layer for smart home
devices. It works over Wi-Fi, ethernet, and the low-power mesh networking protocol and currently supports over 30 device types.
These include lighting, thermostats, locks, refrigerators, dishwashers, dryers, ovens, smoke alarms, air quality monitors, EV
chargers, and more.
A smart home gadget with the Matter logo can be set up and used with any Matter-compatible ecosystem via a and controlled by them
simultaneously, a feature called .
Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home are some major smart home platforms supporting Matter, along with
hundreds of device manufacturers.
Samsung announced a few other enhancements for its platform besides a Matter update. It’s adding a new Hub Manager interface in
the SmartThings app to provide a single place to manage multiple hubs. This adds the option to choose a primary hub as well as a
new Hub Backup feature. If you have multiple , a secondary hub can kick in if the primary hub fails.
SmartThings has significantly in recent years, adding SmartThings hubs into its TVs, , and smart fridges. With the Hub Backup
feature, since it’s more likely you have multiple hubs in your house, if one gets unplugged, fails, or you replace it, your smart
home will continue to operate. Most of Samsung’s newer SmartThings hubs support Thread, Zigbee, and Matter, but only the also
supports Z-Wave.
Samsung Galaxy smartphone users are getting a new quick access Device Control feature. You’ll now be able to choose devices to add
to your own home control page on the phone’s quick panel for fast access to adjust the TV’s volume or change a light’s brightness
without opening the SmartThings app.
SmartThings Energy is getting gamified. Now, if you save 400Wh a day by using the energy management feature, you can earn Samsung
Energy management is a key feature of the smart home, and , SmartThings’ energy management service, is one of the more robust
options. Now, Samsung is adding a neat gamification feature to the platform, which lets you view and manage energy use from
compatible appliances to help you save energy. When you use , which automatically adjusts appliances’ energy use, you can earn an
Energy Stamp for every day you save 400Wh of electricity. These can be converted into Samsung Rewards and spent on Samsung
products at Samsung.com.
The SmartThings app is also getting some interface updates. The Devices tab will now display Rooms as top-level tabs, making
managing your devices by room easier. Searching for devices has also been “enhanced” to help you find what you need quicker.
Devices will also feature more glanceable information on their card, including the device's status — for example, a door lock will
indicate if it’s locked or unlocked.
You’ll also now be able to share any routines or automation you create in the app with friends and family. Shareable Routines will
let you generate a QR code of a routine you’ve created for someone to scan to activate in the SmartThings app.
While these are mostly incremental improvements to the platform, they are all welcome updates that — if they work as advertised —
will make using SmartThings to manage your smart home easier and more reliable. The platform has also been leading the way in
Matter adoption, and while Matter is still we’ve been promised, SmartThings now offers one of the most robust implementations.

The Roomba Combo 10 Max is the company’s first robot vacuum with a charging dock that can wash the bot’s mop as well as empty its
The is a new robot vacuum and mop from iRobot that can wash its mop, empty its bin, and refill its mopping tank — meaning less
manual labor on your part. The company’s new flagship robot vacuum will also be its first to support . The vacuum is available for
preorder starting today at for $1,399.99, and in the and . Shipping starts in August, when it will also come to other retailers.
Building on the retractable mopping system that picks itself up when it vacuums carpet, the is the company’s first robot vac with
a fully multifunction charging dock. In addition to emptying the robot’s bin and filling its water tank, the new dock can clean
and dry the mop and wash itself, so you don’t have to.

The dock also has a new look, to incorporate the mop cleaning, and is now made with antimicrobial plastics to help inhibit the
bacterial growth and bad smells that are common on docks like these. “While there will still need to be an element of human
cleaning [of the dock], this should help combat the build-up of ‘ick’ over time,” iRobot’s Warren Fernandez said in an interview
with The Verge.
These are becoming increasingly popular with models available from Roborock, Dreame, Eufy, and others. They allow the robot vacuum
to work largely independently for a week or so — until you need to fill the dock’s water tank (some eliminate even that need by ).
Most competitor docks require access to the top to get to those tanks, but the 10 Max’s dock keeps the front opening style of the
Unlike many of its competitors, the 10 Max’s dock doesn’t use hot water or hot air to dry the mop — Fernandez explained that
because it’s a top-mounted mop, it will get a lot of airflow, so it dries quickly. He added that heat adds complexity and running
costs to the dock.
According to Fernandez, the 10 Max’s dock automatically cleans and dries the mop pad after every run and can be set to wash after
cleaning specific rooms — the bathroom, for example. The dock also cleans itself after it has washed the pad.
The 10 Max is the first robot vacuum and mop from iRobot that can empty its own bin, refill its water tank, and wash and dry its
mop.
On the software side, Fernandez said the main improvement to the 10 Max is Enhanced Dirt Detect, adding the ability for the
onboard camera to spot dirt. This is an upgrade to a feature on the j9 that . The 10 Max also brings a new mop-only cleaning mode,
in addition to the options to vacuum, and vacuum and mop.
Most other features of the 10 Max are the same as the Combo j9, including the same suction power — which iRobot claims is (the
company doesn’t release suction power specs) — and the presence of a camera for navigating and enabling .
This allows the robot to see and identify common household objects, such as shoes, cables, pet bowls, and other pet-related
clutter, and intelligently determine what to do. For example, it will clean a pile of popcorn but avoid pet poop. iRobot promises
if its robot does roll into a “pet accident,” the company will .

To date, all Roombas have worked with the and smart home platforms, letting you add your vacuum to your and automations and

According to iRobot, Matter support will come via an over-the-air firmware update in Q4 2024; this may coincide with the arrival
of iOS 18, which Apple has said will bring support for .
The company has also said it plans to add Matter across more of its products in 2025, but didn’t specify if this would come as an

CROWDSTRIKE’S FAULTY UPDATE HAS KICKED OFF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO AVOID A SIMILAR TECH DISASTER.
By , a senior editor and author of , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.
If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.
On Friday morning, shortly after midnight in New York, disaster started to unfold around the world. In Australia, shoppers were
met with Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) messages at self-checkout aisles. In the UK, Sky News had to suspend its broadcast after
servers and PCs started crashing. In Hong Kong and India, airport check-in desks began to fail. By the time morning rolled around
in New York, , and a global tech disaster was underway.
In the early hours of the outage, there was confusion over what was going on. How were so many Windows machines suddenly showing a
blue crash screen? “Something super weird happening right now,” Australian cybersecurity expert Troy Hunt wrote in a On Reddit, IT
admins raised the alarm titled “BSOD error in latest CrowdStrike update” that has since racked up more than 20,000 replies.
The problems led to major airlines in the US grounding their fleets and workers in Europe across banks, hospitals, and other major
institutions unable to log in to their systems. And it quickly became apparent that it was all due to one small file.
At 12:09AM ET on July 19th, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike released a faulty update to the Falcon security software it sells to
help companies prevent malware, ransomware, and any other cyber threats from taking down their machines. It’s widely used by
businesses for important Windows systems, which is why the impact of the bad update was so immediate and felt so broadly.
CrowdStrike’s update was supposed to be like any other silent update, automatically providing the very latest protections for its
customers in a tiny file () that’s distributed over the web. CrowdStrike issues these regularly without incident, and they’re
fairly common for security software. But this one was different. It exposed a massive flaw in the company’s cybersecurity product,
a catastrophe that was only ever one bad update away — and one that could have been easily avoided.
CrowdStrike’s Falcon protection software operates in Windows at the kernel level, the core part of an operating system that has
unrestricted access to system memory and hardware. Most other apps run at user mode level and don’t need or get special access to
the kernel. CrowdStrike’s Falcon software uses a special driver that allows it to run at a lower level than most apps so it can
detect threats across a Windows system.
Running at the kernel makes CrowdStrike’s software far more capable as a line of defense — but also far more capable of causing
problems. “That can be very problematic, because when an update comes along that isn’t formatted in the correct way or has some
malformations in it, the driver can ingest that and blindly trust that data,” Patrick Wardle, CEO of DoubleYou and founder of the
Objective-See Foundation, tells The Verge.
Kernel access makes it possible for the driver to create a memory corruption problem, which is what happened on Friday morning.
CrowdStrike spotted the issues quickly, but the damage was already done. The company issued a fix 78 minutes after the original
update went out. IT admins tried rebooting machines over and over and managed to get some back online if the network grabbed the
update before CrowdStrike’s driver killed the server or PC, but for many support workers, the fix has involved and deleting
CrowdStrike’s faulty content update.
While investigations into the CrowdStrike incident continue, the leading theory is that there was likely a bug in the driver that
had been lying dormant for some time. It might not have been validating the data it was reading from the content update files
properly, but that was never an issue until Friday’s problematic content update.
pushed out in the future, the driver would have defenses to check and detect... versus blindly acting and crashing,” says Wardle.
CrowdStrike should have caught this issue sooner. It’s a fairly standard practice to roll out updates gradually, letting
developers test for any major problems before an update hits their entire user base. If CrowdStrike had properly tested its
content updates with a small group of users, then Friday would have been a wake-up call to fix an underlying driver problem rather
than a tech disaster that spanned the globe.
Microsoft didn’t cause Friday’s disaster, but the way Windows operates allowed the entire OS to fall over. The widespread Blue
Screen of Death messages are so synonymous with Windows errors from the ’90s onward that many headlines initially read “Microsoft
outage” before it was clear CrowdStrike was at fault. Now, there are the inevitable questions over how to prevent another
CrowdStrike situation in the future — and that answer can only come from Microsoft.

Despite not being directly involved, Microsoft still controls the Windows experience, and there is plenty of room for improvement
in how Windows handles issues like this.
At the simplest, Windows could disable buggy drivers. If Windows determines that a driver is crashing the system at boot and
forcing it into a recovery mode, Microsoft could build in more intelligent logic that allows a system to boot without the faulty
driver after multiple boot failures.
But the bigger change would be to lock down Windows kernel access to prevent third-party drivers from crashing an entire PC.
Ironically, Microsoft tried to do exactly this with Windows Vista but was met with resistance from cybersecurity vendors and EU
regulators.
Microsoft tried to implement a feature known at the time as PatchGuard in Windows Vista in 2006, restricting third parties from
accessing the kernel. McAfee and Symantec, the big two antivirus companies at the time, opposed Microsoft’s changes, and Symantec
to the European Commission. Microsoft eventually , allowing security vendors access to the kernel once again for security
monitoring purposes.
Apple eventually took that same step, locking down its macOS operating system in 2020 so that developers could no longer get
access to the kernel. “It was definitely the right decision by Apple to deprecate third-party kernel extensions,” says Wardle.
running in user mode could still (kernel panic), and Wardle says Apple “has also introduced some privilege execution
vulnerabilities, and there are still some other bugs that could allow security tools on Mac to be unloaded by malware.”
Regulatory pressures may still be stopping Microsoft from taking action here. over the weekend that “a Microsoft spokesman said it
cannot legally wall off its operating system in the same way Apple does because of an understanding it reached with the European
Commission following a complaint.” The Journal paraphrases the anonymous spokesperson and also mentions a 2009 agreement to
provide security vendors the same level of access to Windows as Microsoft.
Microsoft reached an with the European Commission in 2009 that was a “public undertaking” to allow developers to get access to
technical documentation for building apps on top of Windows. The agreement was formed as part of a deal that included implementing
a browser choice screen in Windows and offering special versions of Windows without Internet Explorer bundled into the OS.
The deal to force Microsoft to offer browser choices ended five years later in 2014, and Microsoft also stopped producing its
special versions of Windows for Europe. Microsoft now bundles its Edge browser in Windows 11, unchallenged by European regulators.
It’s not clear how long this interoperability agreement was in place, but the European Commission doesn’t seem to believe it’s
holding back Microsoft from overhauling Windows security. “Microsoft is free to decide on its business model and to adapt its
security infrastructure to respond to threats provided this is done in line with EU competition law,” European Commission
spokesperson Lea Zuber says in a statement to The Verge. “Microsoft has never raised any concerns about security with the
Microsoft could attempt to go down the same route as Apple, but the pushback from security vendors like CrowdStrike will be
strong. Unlike Apple, Microsoft also competes with CrowdStrike and other security vendors that have made a business out of
protecting Windows. Microsoft has its own paid service, which provides similar protections to Windows machines.
CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz also regularly criticizes Microsoft and its security record and boasts of from Microsoft’s own
security software. Microsoft has had a in recent years, so it’s easy and effective for competitors to use these to sell
alternatives.
Every time Microsoft tries to lock down Windows in the name of security, it also faces backlash. A special mode in Windows 10 that
limited machines to Windows Store apps to avoid malware was . Microsoft also left millions of PCs behind with the launch of
Windows 11 and its that were designed to improve the security of Windows PCs.
Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is about the effects of Microsoft locking down Windows further, framed in a way that Microsoft will
favor its own security products if such a scenario were to occur. All of this pushback means Microsoft has a tricky path to tread
here if it wants to avoid Windows being at the center of a CrowdStrike-like incident again.
Microsoft is stuck in the middle, with pressure from both sides. But at a time when Microsoft is , there has to be some room for
security vendors and Microsoft to agree on a better system that will avoid a world of blue screen outages again.
ON THE VERGECAST: HOW AI MIGHT HELP US REMEMBER EVERYTHING AND HOW A PERFECT MEMORY MIGHT CHANGE OUR LIVES FOREVER.
By , editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The
Wall Street Journal, and Wired.
Humans are terrible at remembering things. We forget things over time; we fail to remember them in the first place because we’re
also not great at paying attention; we misremember things because of our inherent biases and the way we perceive the world.
There’s a lot going on, and we don’t keep much of it for long.
Maybe AI can fix that. It sure looks like we’re about to find out. Microsoft, for instance, is making , an app that promises to
use AI to collect, store, organize, and resurface everything you do and see on your computer. (Imagine just being able to ask your
computer, “What was that article about bees I read the other day? What was the timeline it mentioned?”) At this year’s Google I/O,
the most impressive AI demo was a way to . Apple thinks you might use AI to make photo albums and even emotional videos to
remember great moments. And companies like and are building AI into their own tools to help you find and remember all your
meetings and tasks. They all promise the same thing: don’t worry about remembering things because the computer will do it for you.
And it’ll do it faster and better.
On , we talk to one of the people who has been working on this problem for a very long time: Dan Siroker, the CEO of . We talk
about what it takes to build a great memory aid, how we might use them in the future, and why it’s so tricky to get right.
We also talk about the human side of it all — what does it change about our lives when we stop forgetting things? Is remembering
your friend’s birthday different when it’s actually an AI model doing the remembering? And will these tools ever really work
outside of work? Tools like Limitless are coming fast and improving quickly, and we’re going to have to figure out how to live
with them.

everything from cameras to creativity to cars to just… life. And more recently, as a new parent myself, it’s been really cool to
watch her go through so much of the same stuff as is happening in my house.
I asked Sara to share her homescreen with us, curious to see how she was balancing life stuff with creator stuff. Both are really
demanding, and we’ve all only got one homescreen, you know? Turns out, there’s a bit of both in there — but mostly life stuff.

MAPS GETS EASIER INCIDENT REPORTING AND THE ABILITY TO SEE BUILDING ENTRANCES AND NEARBY PARKING, WHILE WAZE GETS MORE CAMERA
ALERTS AND PROMPTS FOR UPCOMING EVENTS THAT MIGHT AFFECT TRAFFIC.
By , a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support
before joining The Verge.
Improved incident reporting UI and new destination guidance in Google Maps. Image: Google
Google is updating its two navigation apps — Google Maps and Waze — with a , including some changes that bring the two closer
together.
One of the big updates here continues to integrate the biggest features from Waze directly into Maps. For Maps, improved Waze-like
incident reporting adds larger icons to share updates like road closures, construction, speed cameras, or police presence. Other
drivers will be prompted to confirm incidents with a tap.
It can feel like Waze and Google Maps are on a collision course, but the two apps continue to remain separate. Can Comertoglu,
group project manager for Google Maps, told The Verge at a press briefing on Tuesday that Waze users are very dedicated, saying,
contributors, Waze director Tim Queenan tells us.
Google Maps service is also adding new destination guidance that will identify a building’s entrance as you approach it. The
feature will pinpoint the exact building you’re navigating to by highlighting it in red, with a green indicator pointing to the
main entrance of the building. Google will also start showing nearby parking lots.
The improved incident reporting is rolling out now to Google Maps on Android, iOS, cars with Google built-in, and Android Auto and
Apple Carplay, while the destination guidance is rolling out “in the coming weeks.”

Not to be overshadowed by Google Maps, Waze is getting some new tricks, too. Waze users can now report new types of traffic
cameras, like those that go off if you drive in the bus or HOV lanes or those that check for seat belts and whether you’re texting
Waze also has a new dedicated experience for event information that can tell you about road closures for area happenings, like a
marathon, concert, or ball game. You’ll get a push notification after the first road closure for an event that is near your work,
home address, or somewhere you drove recently. The new feature is launching with the 2024 Olympic games and will roll out for
future events as well.

The saga of Spotify HiFi has many twists and turns. First announced , the music service’s higher-quality streaming tier has yet to
materialize. have said lossless audio will be bundled with other perks (like advanced library management, AI-powered playlists,
and headphone sound quality optimization) as an add-on to Spotify’s premium subscription. And today during Spotify’s earnings
call, the company’s CEO, Daniel Ek, confirmed that a better-than-Premium offering is still in the works — though he offered no
firm timetable as to when it’ll be available.
In what might be my favorite ever use of a cliche tech industry phrase, Ek said the effort is still “in early days.” (For those
keeping score at home, it has been 1,247 days since .) “The plan here is to offer much a much better version of Spotify,” Ek said.

That pricing would match of the tier costing around $5 extra on top of Spotify’s $11.99 monthly rate. Whatever final form
Spotify’s lossless audio ultimately takes will be much different than what the company first envisioned. By all indications,
Spotify was caught flat-footed when Apple and Amazon began offering higher-resolution audio as part of their standard subscription
plans. The leading music streamer had always intended to sell it for an added premium.
Those companies can be more aggressive with pricing since they’ve got numerous other divisions to help balance out any losses.
Spotify isn’t so lucky, so the company has had to rejigger its plans and come up with an add-on package that will hopefully prove
compelling to as many of the app’s power users as possible. Finally, the timing seems to be right.

subscription fee to get the ad-free version of Facebook and Instagram or consent to the ad-supported version. Where Meta runs

THE XREAL BEAM PRO HAS GOOD IDEAS ABOUT AR — BUT NOT ENOUGH JUICE
THE XREAL BEAM PRO HAS GOOD IDEAS ABOUT AR — BUT NOT ENOUGH JUICE
IT’S A CONTENT MACHINE, A REMOTE CONTROL, AND A DEDICATED DEVICE FOR YOUR AR GLASSES. BUT FOR ALL ITS CLEVER FEATURES, THIS $200
ANDROID DEVICE JUST CAN’T KEEP UP.
By , editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The
Wall Street Journal, and Wired.
There are two possible paths for augmented reality devices. One path is the all-in-one approach, which you might call the
smartphone path or the Vision Pro Path: you buy a full-fledged single device with everything you need, and when you need an
upgrade, you buy a new one. The other path is the unbundled one: your AR system might be lots of devices rather than just one, and
you’ll upgrade and swap things in as you need them. That path is more like building a home theater system than buying a new
iPhone.
works like a smartphone but is intended to be used mostly as a companion to Xreal’s AR glasses. Xreal has found some success in
the last few years building AR glasses that are essentially just big displays; you can plug in almost anything and see it
projected in front of your face. With the Beam Pro, the company is trying to find a way to give you more and cooler AR stuff to
do, without compromising the whole premise of its devices.
The Beam Pro is a normal-looking Android device — other than those cameras, anyway. Image: Adi Robertson / The Verge
It’s like the glasses and the tablet are in an open relationship; they’re best together but still have plenty of value apart. But
the Beam Pro itself just feels a bit underpowered and unfinished. There are too many bugs in its AR-specific features and too many
times I really felt the sacrifices required to get this thing under $200. Xreal has the beginning of something really clever here,
but I’ll probably wait for the next one.
The Beam Pro has two main jobs, as far as I can tell. The first is just to be a content machine for Xreal glasses, which it
handles fairly well. Since it has access to the Play Store, you can download all the streaming apps, game streaming services, and
whatever else you might want to see on the big virtual screen in your glasses. It has 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM, which is
less than I’d like for something so geared toward photos, videos, and games. For an extra $50, you can get 8GB of RAM and 256GB of
storage, and I recommend spending the money. But either way, unfortunately, the Beam Pro’s other specs keep it from working well
enough to recommend.
As a pure app machine, the Beam Pro really only has two advantages over the phone already in your pocket. For one, it has a dual
camera rig on the back that shoots 1080p 3D video and 50-megapixel 3D photos that you can play back in your glasses. The results
are crisp and fun enough that I’ve used this camera much more than I expected. The Beam Pro also has a second USB-C port, so you
can charge the device and plug it into your glasses simultaneously. I’m not sure how to weigh that convenience against the extra
hassle of carrying and maintaining another device, but it is a nice touch.
The Beam Pro adds an app launcher to your AR space, which is helpful. Screenshot: David Pierce / The Verge
Beyond that, it’s all software. The Beam Pro runs NebulaOS, which is Xreal’s twist on Android designed to work better on your
face. When you plug the Beam Pro into a pair of glasses, you see apps mirrored like you’d expect, but Xreal has also added some
extra UI: there’s an app launcher with a grid of icons that looks a lot like the Vision Pro and a control center that lets you
quickly capture footage or change settings, and you can arrange apps in space in front of your face. It’s not as free-form as
you’d get from Meta or Apple — you basically just stick a couple of apps next to each other — but it’s better than just mirroring
your screen like most Android devices.
When you’re wearing the glasses, NebulaOS has an app that turns the Beam Pro into a remote control. There’s a little round cursor
that you move by moving the device in space, and you tap on the screen to select something. To scroll, you just swipe on the Beam
Pro’s screen. It’s a good idea and a great use of the device, but it doesn’t always work very well. Sometimes the screen registers
a swipe as a tap, sometimes it registers a tap as a double-tap, and sometimes it seems to not be able to match the location of the
cursor with the tap on the screen. In the Netflix app, for instance, I eventually figured out how to go back and forward — by
double-tapping on the screen while pointing the cursor way off to the side — but I still can’t make it pause.

There are little bugs like this all over NebulaOS. The Beam Pro’s in-glasses display can be set to follow your head as you move or
stay anchored in one space, which you select by tapping the orange Mode button on the right side of the device. But in the
following mode, the screen often flickers and judders and lags behind my head; when I set it to stay in one spot, it consistently
drifts downward over time. The Beam Pro just constantly feels like it’s trying to do too much.
Even the hardware feels a bit like an identity crisis. With a 6.5-inch screen, it’s a little big to use in one hand, so the remote
gestures are kind of awkward. The Qualcomm chip inside just isn’t powerful enough to make the AR stuff feel smooth and crisp.
Xreal’s in a tough spot here: if the Beam Pro is $800, nobody’s going to buy it, but it’s somewhere between difficult and
impossible to build a $200 Android device powerful enough to run real-time AR stuff.
I do love watching 3D videos of my dog in my glasses. Screenshot: David Pierce / The Verge
It’s certainly possible that some of the software features can get better over time. I’ve already gotten a bunch of software
updates on the Beam Pro, which have fixed or at least helped with some issues I’ve had. But Xreal’s track record here isn’t great:
a lot of people who bought the original Beam, a much more minimalist remote control and content machine, are still complaining
about the same serious bugs and missing features even months later. You should never buy a device based on promises of future
improvements, but definitely don’t do it here.
Ultimately, I like the Beam Pro most as a fun and relatively inexpensive 3D camera. I don’t know whether spatial video is the
future of anything, but I do enjoy watching my dog splash in the pool with some extra depth. (You can also play Beam Pro content
back on the Vision Pro, which is neat.) When it comes to the AR features, though, I’m mostly opting out. I like Xreal’s idea about
using your devices to power your glasses, but the Beam Pro just doesn’t have the power. I’ll stick with just mirroring my screen.
A BARRAGE OF LEAKS MAY HAVE SPOILED THE PIXEL 9 LINEUP, BUT GOOGLE COULD STILL HAVE SOME SURPRISES IN STORE DURING ITS AUGUST 13TH
EVENT.
By , a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer
and editor at MUO.
Google’s earlier-than-expected Pixel hardware event is . Thanks to the relentless flow of leaks that have emerged over the past
few weeks, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect.
Google has already confirmed that it’s launching the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but the company may have some other
surprises in store, including the Buds Pro 2 and maybe even the Pixel Watch 3.
Here’s a roundup of everything we know so far.
Alongside the Pixel 9, Google is expected to release the Pixel Pro in two sizes: a larger 6.8-inch model and a smaller 6.3-inch
variant. It’ll be the first time the Pro features are available in two different sizes, with the telephoto camera previously being
reserved only for the larger phone model.
As itself (and , ), the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro will also come with some distinct design changes. Both the Pro and standard models are
getting flatter edges and a rounded camera module that protrudes from the back of the device.

A suggests that the Pixel 9 Pro models will come with a G4 Tensor chip (which is expected to ) and 16GB of RAM. Meanwhile, the
base Pixel 9 is expected to have the same chip with a 6.3-inch display and 12GB of RAM. Both phones , with options going up to 1TB
on the Pro model.
The cameras on both devices will likely get some updates as well, with the leaked spec sheet showing the Pixel 9 with a 10.5MP
selfie camera, a 50-megapixel main camera, and a 48MP ultrawide lens. The leak also indicates that the Pixel 9 Pro will have a

Another rumored change coming to the Pixel 9 lineup is the addition of Samsung’s Exynos 5400 modem, potentially powering similar
to newer iPhones. Additionally, a suggests Google may add an lineup, which could hopefully improve some of the issues users have
been having with the existing optical under-display sensor.
The Pixel 9 is expected to , porcelain, rose, and green, while the , porcelain, rose, and hazel.
Those three phones aren’t the only ones Google is planning to release this summer. It’s also getting ready to release its next-gen
foldable, now called the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.
This image of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes straight from Google. Image: Google
When compared to , the Pixel 9 Pro Fold . That design change is also reflected in the squircle-shaped camera housing on the rear
of the device, which now comes with two sets of cameras.
In terms of specs, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is rumored to come with a 6.3-inch cover display and an 8-inch inner screen. That’s larger
than the original Pixel Fold’s 5.8-inch outer display and 7.6-inch inner display. The leaked specs sheet indicates that the Pixel
It may also have a 10MP front-facing camera, with a 48MP main camera, a 10.5MP ultrawide lens, and a 10.8MP telephoto sensor on
the back of the phone. The Pixel Fold is expected to be available in .
and now to bring AI to their phones, it’s no surprise to see Google doing the same. A set of leaked marketing materials from
OnLeaks hints, among other features, at a new Pixel Screenshots feature that “helps you save info that you want to remember later

That tracks with a previous leak from Android Police, which suggests that the , letting you search through them. It sounds a bit
like but appears to only work on the screenshots you take manually, rather than scanning your entire device. The marketing
materials also show an integration with Google’s AI chatbot Gemini, along with Circle to Search.
This feature appears to use AI to completely transform the background of a photo. Image: OnLeaks via Android Headlines
A leaked Pixel 9 ad posted by Android Headlines (it has since been taken down) gave us a glimpse at a feature to put someone in a
photo when they weren’t originally there. It looks like Google is planning to , too, allowing you to replace the background of an
image based on a prompt.
THE PIXEL BUDS PRO 2 BRINGS BACK THE WING TIP
It’s already been two years since the launch of the original Pixel Buds Pro, and now it looks like Google is planning to give them
a refresh. Leaked images from OnLeaks show the Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a small wing tip that sticks out from the side of each bud —
sort of like a smaller version of the .
Other small changes include larger grills that match the colors of the bud, as well as a charging case that appears to come with a
small speaker (maybe to emit a noise when using Google’s Find My feature?). The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are expected to come in gray,
white, green, and pink.
What appears to be the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a mint green. Image: OnLeaks via
We may have a good idea of what the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will look like, but we don’t know much about the specs. A regulatory listing
spotted earlier this year suggests the case may come with a larger 650mAh battery. Other than that, we can likely expect the Pixel
Buds Pro 2 to feature the same active noise cancellation and multipoint features .
A PIXEL WATCH 3 WITH TWO SIZES AND BIGGER SCREENS
So far, we’ve only seen that show a device with . Unlike its predecessor, the Pixel Watch 3 is expected to come in two sizes: 41mm
and 45mm. The 41mm version is rumored to come with a 10 percent larger screen than its similarly sized predecessor, .
A render of what looks like the 45mm Pixel Watch 3. Image: OnLeaks via
Recent leaks also suggest both Pixel Watch 3 models will get a brighter 2,000-nit display and that could make location tracking
more accurate. The 41mm watch is also rumored to come with and 20 percent faster charging than the Pixel Watch 2.
Both sizes could offer up to 24 hours of battery life with always-on display enabled or up to 36 hours with a new Battery Saver
mode, according to leaked marketing materials shared . The materials also hint at support for offline Google Maps, new camera
controls when connecting to a Pixel phone, and the ability to view your Nest Cam and Nest Doorbell’s live feeds from your watch.

Unfortunately, you may not be able to use your current Pixel Watch 2 bands with the larger 45mm device. A report suggests that the
It may seem like we already know all we know about Google’s upcoming hardware event, but the company may still surprise us. For
one, there’s a possibility that we may get a look at the which leaked images of in July. It looks way different , but we still
don’t have any details on specs.
That’s all we know for now, but there’s still time between now and Google’s August 13th event, which means there’s still a chance
for more leaks.
Update, July 31st: Added more rumored specs for the Pixel 9.

Every month or so, we like to ask our staff — whether it’s board games, smart tech, or kitchen gadgets. And the results are
usually very different, very interesting, and a lot of fun.
Since Amazon is pushing a lot of deals as part of its annual — which ends in just a few hours, if you weren’t paying attention —
we looked through some of our recent “favorites” articles and found deals on a lot of the devices we like. So, we thought we’d
list a few in case you have read about them in the past and thought, well, that sort of sounds good, but it’s a bit pricey. (Or —
that’s pretty cheap, but maybe I’ll wait until the price goes down even more...)
So, what follows are some of our staff’s most-liked games, smart home devices, kitchen helpers, travel gear, and pet tech.
A strategy card game in which players compete to build Renaissance Europe’s most lucrative and prestigious jewelry business.
The best part about the game is taking a moment to look around and watch your friends thinking really, really hard. This is a
board game that has no board, just cards and chips, where the objective is to collect gems and acquire capital and property. It is
best played with three to five people on a large table, and it involves a whole lot of strategizing, thinking, and endlessly
I ditched the box for a and now bring this game to most bar hangs. And when I’m at home, I find it best when paired with a that
you won’t have to spend any extra mental strength thinking about. 
A strategy board game in which you enter the mysterious world of the Earth’s oceans.
Finding a board game that will entertain a 13-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy, my partner, and me is a challenge. We’ve cycled
through all the classics as well as newer options — Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, Catan, and more. While these are all great,
inevitably one of the group develops a passionate dislike for the game (usually after a few too many losses) and it drops off our
rotation. However, Evolution: Oceans has been a constant crowd-pleaser for over six months now, and we all love it. 
Part of the Evolution series from , Oceans is a beautiful, complicated, compelling, and challenging strategy game. You create new
species to fill your ocean and fight to develop them and keep them alive using adaptations and abilities such as schooling and
Cards give you your powers, and these are gorgeously illustrated, making this game a visual feast. It does have a fairly steep
learning curve, but once you get going and the strategies unfold, the gameplay is smooth and relatively fast-paced. There is a
fair amount of player-to-player interaction, so we’ve had a couple of temper tantrums, but nothing big enough to knock this one
off our family’s top spot… at least not yet.
Reliably adjusts irrigation systems to not run before, during, or after a rainstorm, even adapting based on the amount of rain
that falls, using a Wi-Fi-connected system. It can handle four, eight, and 16 zones.
Don’t you hate it when you come home during a rainstorm and your sprinklers are running? What a waste of water! With a smart
sprinkler controller, you can avoid this kind of insult to Mother Earth. I’ve used a for a few years now, and it reliably adjusts
my irrigation system to not run before, during, or after a rainstorm, even adapting based on the amount of rain that falls. The
Wi-Fi-connected system uses local weather data, so I do have to keep an eye on it; if the forecast calls for an inch of rain but
we only get a sprinkle, my garden might go thirsty. But its easy-to-use app makes this adjustment something I can do from the
comfort of my couch. It’s a lot like using a smart thermostat and just as satisfying in terms of feeling good about saving
precious resources (and money).
This smart Wi-Fi plug not only lets you control your stuff but also helps you monitor energy usage.
The single fastest and most reliable device in my entire smart home… is whichever dumb-as-a-brick appliance I plug in to this tiny
box. Seriously, I’m pretty sure the is the only smart home device that’s never let me down. Whether it’s a string of Christmas
lights, a garage freezer, a hot water recirculation pump, a humidifier, a bedside lamp, or a fan — all genuine examples from my
home — I always know Alexa or Google or Siri or Home Assistant will flick that virtual switch in an instant and / or follow my
programmed schedule.
Plus, I get some energy savings, too! My Brother printer used to draw 4W all day every day; now, I only spend 0.5–0.8W for the
Smart Plug Mini it’s plugged in to. I just wish TP-Link stopped making so many new versions so I could tell you which one to buy.
I do know I’d have bought if I’d had a little more foresight. 
Tamper-proof smart lock for keyless entry, including a keypad deadbolt.
I always lose my keys. I must open the Find My app every single time I need to leave the house to find them. It’s worse when I go
for a run because it means having to stuff them in a running belt, pocket, or worst of all — my sports bra. So, installing the has
been a game changer for me.
For runs and walks, I can head out the door with nothing but my headphones and smartwatch. It’s so freeing! The same goes for just
leaving my house to do literally anything. My spouse and I have the questionable habit of listening to scary true crime podcasts
right before bed. That used to mean playing rock, paper, scissors to see which of us had to run down three flights of stairs to
check if the door was locked. Not anymore! Now we can just ask Google Assistant or whip out the phone. I love that we can also
create temporary guest passcodes for pet sitters or relatives who visit. It’s only been a few weeks, but this has been the
simplest yet most high-impact quality-of-life upgrade I’ve done in a long time. 
Uses bright yellow coloring and sticky glue to catch nasty little pests. You can buy them in various quantities.
At my last apartment, I kept all my plants in the windowsill. Unfortunately, we were on the ground floor, there were bushes
outside, and whenever my spouse opened the window for some fresh air, we got fungus gnats. 
First, I tried neem oil and diatomaceous earth, but they were stinky and didn’t work well. You know what did? Good ole . Push ’em
into the pot and watch in fascinated disgust as it catches all of the nasty critters. (Just be careful if you have cats or other
curious pets — one of my cats had a small bald patch on his butt for a week after a trap got stuck on him.) They’re also cheap and
handy in the summer if you’ve developed a fruit fly situation in your kitchen.
The six-quart Instant Pot makes it quick and easy to prepare a variety of foods, ranging from rice and ribs to yogurt and assorted
soups.
I’ve never been a great cook, so in an attempt to get me to eat more home-cooked food, my mom gifted me an Instant Pot. This was
years ago, and I’ve never looked back. I am the queen of soups, but it’s such a handy tool to cut down cooking time and effort on
almost any dish. For the most part, you just toss in all the ingredients, set the timer, and go about your business.
An elegant electric gooseneck kettle with a 0.8 liter / 27 ounce capacity.
Okay, hear me out! Watering cans take up too much space, and single-use gadgets are a waste of money. So, ever since I got overly
involved in my coffee routine, I have been watering my indoor plants with the Aroma Housewares Professional electric kettle (this
is, sadly, no longer sold, but any similar kettle will do). The gooseneck is perfect for making it over the ridge of a pot, the
spout is small so it allows for control over where the water is falling, and the handle makes it feel just like a watering can.
Plus, it sits on my counter looking pretty, right next to my faucet where I need to fill it up. So, instead of buying a kettle
with an open mouth spout,  and bada bing — you got a two-in-one gadget. Just make sure it has cooled down before you start
A 5.5-cup-capacity rice cooker and warmer that not only cooks rice but also comes with a steaming basket to double as a steamer
and a cake menu setting to bake cakes.
A lot of people will tell you that rice cookers are single-use appliances meant only for rice — they’re wrong. A rice cooker
is best at cooking rice, but it can do a lot of the same things as an Instant Pot. For instance, you can use it to cook hardboiled
eggs or oatmeal, steam vegetables, make porridge, make one-pot meals, and even bake a cake. 
I grew up with giant 10-cup rice cookers at home, but I didn’t appreciate how versatile this appliance was until I left the
country for college. A tiny two-cup rice cooker kept me fed in my cramped 250-square-foot Tokyo apartment. It was programmable, so
I could wash my rice, stick it in the cooker, and know that when I woke up late for class, I could still whip up some  or oatmeal
for a quick, cheap, and nutritious breakfast. (It also took the hassle out of steel-cut oats.) Whenever I had a craving for
sweets, it was so easy to take pancake mix and  for one.
I’ve since graduated to a 5.5-cup , and it’s one of the handiest tools I have for meal prepping. When I was sick I made ample use
of its porridge setting to make a congee-type dish with chicken and ginger — just like my mom used to make when I was a kid. The
fact that it’ll keep something warm for days meant I could crawl out of bed, scoop out some porridge, and crawl back into bed with
minimal effort. When I’m feeling lazy, I throw eggs in there, and bam — some extra hard-boiled protein. Mine also comes with a
little basket, so it’s super easy to throw in veggies or steam frozen dumplings.
But what I like most is that rice cookers are more space-efficient than Instant Pots. In my kitchen, the one spot where I could
fit an Instant Pot is instead occupied by a rice cooker, blender, and spoon rest. A multitasking kitchen gadget that doesn’t take
over your entire counter? That’s a must if you live in a small space.
The Joseph Joseph Garlic Rocker is just a simple curved piece of metal with holes in it, but it’s one of the easiest and most
effective ways to mince / crush garlic.
We use a lot of garlic in my household, and traditional garlic presses never did it for us — they usually produced a messy, slushy
paste. A friend of ours introduced us to the garlic rocker, which is not only fun to play with but produces beautifully minced
pieces of garlic, perfect for sautéing and other uses. And it looks like a strange work of art, which means we can keep it on the
counter just for show.
Expandable backpack that comes with a lot of storage space and packing cubes.
the globe. My ratty old secondhand carry-on bag was the first thing to be replaced. After several days of weighing the pros and
cons of various travel bags, I stumbled upon this  on Amazon, and it fit all of my needs. It can carry a laptop, several days’
worth of clothes, my , and more. The bag even includes some packing cubes. It’s very comfortable, and the weight is well
distributed when it’s completely full. It’s an inexpensive alternative to many name-brand carry-on bags, too. So far, I’ve used it
on a handful of trips, and the quality has held up. It also holds onto pet fur, though, so I had to add a small lint roller to my
travel necessities. But that’s just life while traveling with a dog anyway.
The rugged Wonderboom 3 packs plenty of punch for its size, allowing you to dish out 360-degree sound for up to 14 hours with or
without stereo pairing. It also floats, rendering it a potential pool party mainstay.
Okay, it’s time to admit it — I have a well-used, not-at-all-new, not-at-all-smart car. It’s a 2007 Honda Civic, and the most
technologically advanced thing it does is allow me to roll down the windows by pressing a button. No Bluetooth, no screens —
nothing like that. It’s not that I don’t like having tech in my car, but I’m the sort of car owner who holds onto their auto as
long as possible until it starts to become more expensive to fix it than to buy a new one. And so far, I haven’t hit that
milestone.
Not that there aren’t issues, the most serious of which lately is that the port that I used to plug into in order to listen to my
music on the car’s stereo system no longer works. (Not to mention the fact that my Pixel 6 doesn’t have an audio port anyway.) So,
I’ve compromised by using a small portable speaker (a ), paired via Bluetooth to my phone, to act as the speaker for my mapping
directions, music, and audiobooks. At least this way, while I’m visiting friends and relatives over the summer months, I won’t
have to depend on the very old-fashioned method of listening to whatever happens to be on the radio. 
This all-in-one 20W power cube boasts three AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and one USB-C port.
Nobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying
in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming
historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that
the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there’s already two lamps plugged into
Older buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy
socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall
because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a
weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I
bought this . It’s not a full power strip — just a cube with a few sockets along with USB and USB-C charging ports at the end of a
five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase, but each time has left me
The three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose
sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person,
and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.
If you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type for the region you’re going to or pack an adapter. 
Epicka’s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries.
In my youth, I forgot to pack plug adaptors for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another
country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for
your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I
never leave this country without a universal travel adaptor.
Basically, it’s six plug adaptors in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple
devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adaptor plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent
itinerary, it’s a game changer. What I like about  is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.
The only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you
by in most countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I’ll take this over price
gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store.
Qi wireless car charger with a one-touch mechanism and foot that adjusts to fit large and extra-large smartphones up to 3.7
inches.
Maybe someday Apple will realize that it wasn’t the brightest idea , and you’ll be able to plop your phone on a magical minimalist
disc that charges it at high speeds. In the meantime, a standard Qi charger is about the best you’ll get — and the bulky but
practical  does it with the satisfying snap of springs. When you push your phone into its waiting jaws, it depresses a button that
causes those jaws to firmly snap closed on either side of your device. When you want to remove it, you pinch a pair of levers with
your finger and thumb to release as you grab your slab. It’s wide enough to fit practically anything on the market, save an opened
Samsung Z Fold. I’ve used one for years with Android and Apple phones alike, including newer MagSafe handsets. 
Doles out the right amount of food for your pet; can be controlled via smartphone or Alexa.
I couldn’t live without my automatic pet feeders. I have a total of 14 mouths to feed in my household — one dog, one cat, lots of
chickens, a bunny rabbit, two kids, and a husband. Making sure everyone gets what they need when they need it could be a full-time
job. Being able to delegate feeding the dog and the cat to two separate  means two fewer mouths for me to worry about. 
In the PetSafe app, I can program how many meals they get each day and what time each is fed as well as determine how big each
portion is — helpful now that my 74-pound puppy, Gus, is on a vet-instructed diet. The cat, Smokey, has his feeder up on a table
so Gus doesn’t sneak in any extra portions. (There are some feeders that can recognize your pet based on their chip, but the table
works, too!) If someone needs a snack, I can just press the button on the feeder, and they get a little extra, or I can ask Alexa
to dispense a specific amount. It’s the kind of hands-free convenience that makes the smart home so helpful.
Automatic cat litter box with multiple sensors to keep things neat and odor-free.
We have two cats, Pouncey and Oscar, who have always shared a litter box. Oscar, the younger one, is quite messy — jumping out of
the box with reckless abandon and spreading litter all over. We initially had a covered box to slightly circumvent this, but last
year, we opted for a  to keep things tidier. (It was on sale for a little more than $400 then.) Like much smart home tech, it’s
excellent in some ways and not so great in others.
I love that I’m no longer scooping litter every day, and if we ever go on a trip, we don’t have to ask friends or family to handle
poop duties in addition to feedings. But it’s a blessing and a curse because, if I don’t empty out the waste bin on time, it piles
up too high. Ever tried opening a jam-packed kitchen drawer with a ladle sticking up inside it? You know that sense of frustration
when it hits the top of the frame and the drawer gets stuck? Picture that, but instead, it’s clumped-up cat pee smearing across
the underside as you pull it out. Yeah, not ideal. So, it handles the daily duties, but it keeps me on schedule, or I end up
wrist-deep in the other doodies.

Update, July 17th: Adjusted the intro to account for the fact Prime Day is drawing to a close.
Will your next MacBook have a rotating display? According to , it’s definitely possible. Apple recently won a for a with a
rotating, detachable screen. The patent also mentions backside cameras that are either fixed or attachable.
According to the sketches and descriptions, the display won’t rotate in the traditional sense. Instead, it looks like the design
will incorporate a “base portion which could be movably, pivotally, or rotatably connected or affixed to a display portion, for
example, by way of a hinge assembly.” That means users could potentially detach the display, flip it into the base, and position
it accordingly. Rotating the display would make this MacBook ideal for conference calls and presentations.
While that’s tantalizing news, the camera portion of the patent is equally compelling. Several imaginings of this back-mounted
camera are included, as well as LIDAR, facial recognition, and infrared sensors. Some of the illustrations show the camera sitting
flush against the panel, while others show the camera jutting out, similar to what you’d find on an iPhone camera module.
The most intriguing portion of the patent discusses a “second camera module,” where an “optical component” can be attached to
either the front or back of the lid. However, there’s no mention of how the dual cameras would be used. Is Apple thinking about
improving FaceTime or video conferencing as a whole? Or maybe there’s a way to use the extra module to get the perfect shot?
We’ll have to wait and see if Apple decides to incorporate either design in the next-gen MacBooks.
